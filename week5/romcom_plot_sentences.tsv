My Fair Lady	0	80	ainy night in Edwardian London, opera patrons are waiting under the arches of Covent Garden for cabs.
My Fair Lady	1	80	Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl, runs into a young man called Freddy.
My Fair Lady	2	80	She admonishes him for spilling her bunches of violets in the mud, but she cheers up after selling one to an older gentleman.
My Fair Lady	3	80	She then flies into an angry outburst when a man copying down her speech is pointed out to her.
My Fair Lady	4	80	The man explains that he studies phonetics and can identify anyone's origin by their accent.
My Fair Lady	5	80	He laments Eliza's dreadful speech, asking why so many English people don't speak properly and explaining his theory that this is what truly separates social classes, rather than looks or money ("Why Can't the English.
My Fair Lady	6	80	").
My Fair Lady	7	80	He declares that in six months he could turn Eliza into a lady by teaching her to speak properly.
My Fair Lady	8	80	The older gentleman introduces himself as Colonel Pickering, a linguist who has studied Indian dialects.
My Fair Lady	9	80	The phoneticist introduces himself as Henry Higgins, and, as they both have always wanted to meet each other, Higgins invites Pickering to stay at his home in London.
My Fair Lady	10	80	He distractedly throws his change into Eliza's basket, and she and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable, proper life ("Wouldn't It Be Loverly.
My Fair Lady	11	80	").
My Fair Lady	12	80	Plot.
My Fair Lady	13	80	Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle, and his drinking companions, Harry and Jamie, all dustmen, stop by the next morning.
My Fair Lady	14	80	He is searching for money for a drink, and Eliza shares her profits with him ("With a Little Bit of Luck").
My Fair Lady	15	80	Pickering and Higgins are discussing vowels at Higgins's home when mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, informs Higgins that a young woman with a ghastly accent has come to see him.
My Fair Lady	16	80	It is Eliza, who has come to take speech lessons so she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop.
My Fair Lady	17	80	Pickering wagers that Higgins cannot make good on his claim and volunteers to pay for Eliza's lessons.
My Fair Lady	18	80	An intensive makeover of Eliza's speech, manners and dress begins in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball.
My Fair Lady	19	80	Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted, patient man who cannot get along with women ("I'm an Ordinary Man").
My Fair Lady	20	80	To others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic.
My Fair Lady	21	80	Alfred Doolittle is informed that his daughter has been taken in by Professor Higgins, and considers that he might be able to make a little money from the situation ("With a Little Bit of Luck" [Reprise]).
My Fair Lady	22	80	Doolittle arrives at Higgins's house the next morning, claiming that Higgins is compromising Eliza's virtue.
My Fair Lady	23	80	Higgins is impressed by the man's natural gift for language and brazen lack of moral values.
My Fair Lady	24	80	He and Doolittle agree that Eliza can continue to take lessons and live at Higgins's house if Higgins gives Doolittle five pounds for a spree.
My Fair Lady	25	80	Higgins flippantly recommends Doolittle to an American millionaire who has written to Higgins seeking a lecturer on moral values.
My Fair Lady	26	80	Meanwhile, Eliza endures speech tutoring, endlessly repeating phrases like "In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen‚Äù (initially, the only "h" she aspirates is in "hever") and "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" (to practice the "long a" phoneme).
My Fair Lady	27	80	Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill Higgins, from sickness to drowning to a firing squad ("Just You Wait").
My Fair Lady	28	80	The servants lament the hard "work" Higgins does ("The Servants' Chorus").
My Fair Lady	29	80	Just as they give up, Eliza suddenly recites "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" in perfect upper-class style.
My Fair Lady	30	80	Higgins, Eliza, and Pickering happily dance around Higgins's study ("The Rain in Spain").
My Fair Lady	31	80	Thereafter she speaks with impeccable received pronunciation.
My Fair Lady	32	80	mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed; she declares she is too excited to sleep ("I Could Have Danced All Night").
My Fair Lady	33	80	For her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at Ascot Racecourse ("Ascot Gavotte").
My Fair Lady	34	80	Henry's mother reluctantly agrees to help Eliza make conversation, following Henry's advice that Eliza should stick to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.
My Fair Lady	35	80	Eliza makes a good impression at first with her polite manners but later shocks everyone with her vulgar Cockney attitudes and slang.
My Fair Lady	36	80	She does, however, capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill, the young man she ran into in the opening scene.
My Fair Lady	37	80	Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, but she refuses to see him.
My Fair Lady	38	80	He declares that he will wait for her as long as necessary in the street outside Higgins's house ("On the Street Where You Live").
My Fair Lady	39	80	Eliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball, and after weeks of preparation, she is ready.
My Fair Lady	40	80	All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with her son, the prince ("Embassy Waltz").
My Fair Lady	41	80	Eliza then dances with Higgins.
My Fair Lady	42	80	A rival and former student of Higgins, a Hungarian phonetician named Zoltan Karpathy, is employed by the hostess to discover Eliza's origins through her speech.
My Fair Lady	43	80	Though Pickering and his mother caution him not to, Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.
My Fair Lady	44	80	The event is revealed to have been a success, with Zoltan Karpathy having concluded that Eliza is "not only Hungarian, but of royal blood.
My Fair Lady	45	80	She is a princess.
My Fair Lady	46	80	" After the ball, Pickering flatters Higgins on his triumph, and Higgins expresses his pleasure that the experiment is now over ("You Did It").
My Fair Lady	47	80	The episode leaves Eliza feeling used and abandoned.
My Fair Lady	48	80	Higgins completely ignores Eliza until he mislays his slippers.
My Fair Lady	49	80	He asks her where they are, and she lashes out at him, leaving the clueless professor mystified by her ingratitude.
My Fair Lady	50	80	When Eliza decides to leave Higgins, he insults her in frustration and storms off.
My Fair Lady	51	80	Eliza cries as she prepares to leave ("Just You Wait" [Reprise]).
My Fair Lady	52	80	She finds Freddy still waiting outside ("On the Street Where You Live" [Reprise]).
My Fair Lady	53	80	He begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she cuts him off, telling him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it ("Show Me").
My Fair Lady	54	80	She and Freddy return to Covent Garden, where her friends do not recognize her with her newly refined bearing ("The Flower Market/Wouldn't It Be Loverly.
My Fair Lady	55	80	" [Reprise]).
My Fair Lady	56	80	By chance, her father is there as well, dressed in a fine suit.
My Fair Lady	57	80	He explains that he received a surprise bequest of four thousand pounds a year from the American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry Eliza's "stepmother", the woman he has been living with for many years.
My Fair Lady	58	80	Eliza sees that she no longer belongs in Covent Garden, and she and Freddy depart.
My Fair Lady	59	80	Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding ("Get Me to the Church on Time").
My Fair Lady	60	80	Higgins awakens the next morning to find that, without Eliza, he has tea instead of coffee, and cannot find his own files.
My Fair Lady	61	80	He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women ("A Hymn to Him").
My Fair Lady	62	80	Pickering, becoming annoyed with Higgins, leaves to stay with his friend at the Home Office.
My Fair Lady	63	80	Higgins seeks his mother's advice and finds Eliza having tea with her.
My Fair Lady	64	80	Higgins's mother leaves Higgins and Eliza together.
My Fair Lady	65	80	Eliza explains that Higgins has always treated her as a flower girl, but she learned to be a lady because Pickering treated her as one.
My Fair Lady	66	80	Higgins claims he treated her the same way that Pickering did because both Higgins and Pickering treat all women alike.
My Fair Lady	67	80	Eliza accuses him of wanting her only to fetch and carry for him, saying that she will marry Freddy because he loves her.
My Fair Lady	68	80	She declares she no longer needs Higgins, saying she was foolish to think she did ("Without You").
My Fair Lady	69	80	Higgins is struck by Eliza's spirit and independence and wants her to stay with him, but she tells him that he will not see her again.
My Fair Lady	70	80	As Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza ("I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face").
My Fair Lady	71	80	He cannot bring himself to confess that he loves her, and insists to himself that if she marries Freddy and then comes back to him, he will not accept her.
My Fair Lady	72	80	But he finds it difficult to imagine being alone again.
My Fair Lady	73	80	He reviews the recording he made of the morning Eliza first came to him for lessons.
My Fair Lady	74	80	He hears his own harsh words: "She's so deliciously low.
My Fair Lady	75	80	So horribly dirty.
My Fair Lady	76	80	" Then the phonograph turns off, and a real voice speaks in a Cockney accent: "I washed me face an' 'ands before I come, I did".
My Fair Lady	77	80	It is Eliza, standing in the doorway, tentatively returning to him.
My Fair Lady	78	80	The musical ends on an ambiguous moment of possible reconciliation between teacher and pupil, as Higgins slouches and asks, "Eliza, where the devil are my slippers.
My Fair Lady	79	80	".

Pride and Prejudice	8	55	Jane visits Miss Bingley and is caught in a rain shower on the way, catching a serious cold.
Pride and Prejudice	9	55	Elizabeth, out of genuine concern for her sister's well being, visits her sister there.

Pride and Prejudice	11	55	Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family.
Pride and Prejudice	12	55	He is a pompous and obsequious clergyman because he expects each of the Bennet girls to wish to marry him due to his inheritance.
Pride and Prejudice	13	55	He plans to propose to Elizabeth over Jane as he is led to believe Jane is taken.
Pride and Prejudice	14	55	Elizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming Mr Wickham who singles out Elizabeth and tells her a story of the hardship that Mr Darcy has caused him by depriving him of a living (position as clergyman in a prosperous parish with good revenue that once granted, is for life) promised to him by Mr Darcy's late father.
Pride and Prejudice	15	55	Elizabeth's dislike of Mr Darcy is confirmed.
Pride and Prejudice	16	55	At a ball at which Mr Wickham is not present, Elizabeth dances with Mr Darcy rather against her will.
Pride and Prejudice	17	55	Other than Jane and Elizabeth, all the members of the Bennet family show their lack of decorum.

Pride and Prejudice	21	55	They receive news that the Bingleys are leaving for London, and that Mr Collins has proposed to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible lady and Elizabeth's friend.

Pride and Prejudice	33	55	Mr Darcy, however, has fallen in love with Elizabeth and proposes to her.
Pride and Prejudice	34	55	She rejects him, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness, and accuses him of treating Mr Wickham unjustly.
Pride and Prejudice	35	55	Mr Darcy accuses her family of wanting propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself.
Pride and Prejudice	36	55	Both are furious and they part barely speaking.
Pride and Prejudice	37	55	The following morning, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter that explains that his treatment of Mr Wickham was caused by the fact that Mr Wickham refused the Living and was compensated economically, but then proceeded to waste all the money and then, impoverished, demanded the Living again with threats.
Pride and Prejudice	38	55	After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister Georgiana for her great dowry, as Colonel FitzWilliam could also attest.

Pride and Prejudice	45	55	However, she suddenly has news from Longbourne that her sister Lydia had eloped with Mr Wickham.

Pride and Prejudice	47	55	After an agonizing wait, Mr Wickham is persuaded to marry Lydia with only the payment of debts required.
Pride and Prejudice	48	55	With some degree of decency restored, Lydia visits Elizabeth and tells her that Mr Darcy was at the wedding.
Pride and Prejudice	49	55	Mrs Gardiner informs Elizabeth that it is Mr Darcy who has made the match and hints that he may have a motive for doing so.
Pride and Prejudice	50	55	At this point, Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy return to Netherfield.
Pride and Prejudice	51	55	Bingley proposes to Jane and is accepted, much to the delight of all.
Pride and Prejudice	52	55	Lady Catherine visits Elizabeth under the impression that she is going to marry Mr Darcy, Elizabeth refuses to deny this claim and Lady Catherine leaves outraged by her perceived insolence.

Going My Way	0	35	Father Charles ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù O‚ÄôMalley (Bing Crosby), an incoming priest from East st Louis, arrives in New York City with an unconventional style that will transform the parish life of st Dominic‚Äôs Church.
Going My Way	1	35	On his first day, O'Malley gets into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald).
Going My Way	2	35	The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O‚ÄôMalley‚Äôs recreational habits&nbsp;‚Äì particularly his golf-playing&nbsp;‚Äì and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O‚ÄôDowd (Frank McHugh).
Going My Way	3	35	In a discussion between O'Malley and O'Dowd without Fitzgibbon present, it is revealed that O‚ÄôMalley was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor.
Going My Way	4	35	To spare Fitzgibbon‚Äôs feelings, the older pastor is kept unaware of this arrangement and believes that O‚ÄôMalley is simply his assistant.
Going My Way	5	35	A series of events highlights the difference between O‚ÄôMalley and Fitzgibbon‚Äôs styles, as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James (Jean Heather) having run away from home.
Going My Way	6	35	The most consequential difference of opinion between O‚ÄôMalley and Fitzgibbon arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi (Stanley Clements).
Going My Way	7	35	Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance.
Going My Way	8	35	O‚ÄôMalley seeks to make inroads into the boys‚Äô lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir.
Going My Way	9	35	The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who finally decides to go to the bishop and ask for O‚ÄôMalley to be transferred away.
Going My Way	10	35	In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop‚Äôs intention to put O‚ÄôMalley in charge of the parish.
Going My Way	11	35	To avoid an uncomfortable situation, instead of making his initial request, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O‚ÄôMalley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate of losing control over the church, he informs O‚ÄôMalley of his new role.
Going My Way	12	35	A distressed Fitzgibbon then runs away, leading to a search.
Going My Way	13	35	He returns late at night, and as O‚ÄôMalley puts the older priest to bed, the two begin to bond.
Going My Way	14	35	They discuss Fitzgibbon‚Äôs long-put-off desire to go to Ireland and see his mother, whom he's not seen since he left Ireland as a young priest to come to America, and who is now over 90.
Going My Way	15	35	O‚ÄôMalley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, ‚ÄúToo Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral‚Äù.
Going My Way	16	35	Jenny Tuffel (now Genevieve Linden) (Ris√´ Stevens), an old girlfriend of O'Malley's whom he left to join the priesthood, now has a successful acting and singing career.
Going My Way	17	35	O'Malley and Jenny discuss their past, and she performs a number from her starring role as Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera.
Going My Way	18	35	O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr.
Going My Way	19	35	(James Brown), the son of the church's mortgage-holder, Ted Haines Sr.
Going My Way	20	35	(Gene Lockhart).
Going My Way	21	35	On this visit, O‚ÄôMalley describes to the young couple his calling in life to ‚Äúgo his way,‚Äù which to him means to follow after the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same.
Going My Way	22	35	He performs for them the song ‚ÄúGoing My Way,‚Äù which he wrote on this theme.
Going My Way	23	35	Jenny visits O‚ÄôMalley at the church, sees the boys‚Äô choir, and reads the sheet music of ‚ÄúGoing My Way.
Going My Way	24	35	‚Äù She, O'Malley, and Father O‚ÄôDowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, perform ‚ÄúGoing My Way‚Äù with the choir and a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, thereby saving the church from its financial woes.
Going My Way	25	35	The plan fails, as the music executive (William Frawley) brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell.
Going My Way	26	35	The choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings another song, "Swinging on a Star".
Going My Way	27	35	The executive overhears the song and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.
Going My Way	28	35	With the church affairs in order, O‚ÄôMalley and Fitzgibbon go on a golf course together.
Going My Way	29	35	Just as everything seems to have fallen into place, though, the parish church is damaged in a massive fire.
Going My Way	30	35	O'Malley prepares to move on to a new assignment from the bishop.
Going My Way	31	35	He leaves O‚ÄôDowd to be Fitzgibbon‚Äôs new assistant, putting Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir.
Going My Way	32	35	On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a service that also serves as O'Malley's farewell.
Going My Way	33	35	As a going-away present, O‚ÄôMalley has sent for Fitzgibbon‚Äôs mother from Ireland.
Going My Way	34	35	As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings ‚ÄúToo-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral‚Äù, as Father O‚ÄôMalley quietly slips away into the night.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	0	53	The play consists of four interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazon queen, Hippolyta, which is set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of Fairyland, under the light of the moon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	1	53	The play opens with Hermia, who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father Egeus' demand that she wed Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	2	53	Helena meanwhile pines unrequitedly for Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	3	53	Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian law before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or else face death.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	4	53	Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity while worshipping the goddess Artemis as a nun.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	5	53	Peter Quince and his fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout, and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, "the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	6	53	Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them to the players.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	7	53	Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	8	53	He would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	9	53	Bottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players hanged.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	10	53	Quince ends the meeting with "at the Duke's oak we meet".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	11	53	In a parallel plot line, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	12	53	Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	13	53	Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his "knight" or "henchman", since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	14	53	Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	15	53	He calls upon Robin "Puck" Goodfellow, his "shrewd and knavish sprite", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called "love-in-idleness", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	16	53	When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	17	53	He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	18	53	He says, "And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	19	53	Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of eloping.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	20	53	Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	21	53	Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	22	53	However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	23	53	Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	24	53	Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	25	53	Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	26	53	Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	27	53	Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	28	53	When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	29	53	Upon waking up, he sees Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	30	53	Now, both men are in pursuit of Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	31	53	However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	32	53	Hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her, and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	33	53	The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	34	53	Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	35	53	Meanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers ("rude mechanicals", as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's bower, for their rehearsal.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	36	53	Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	37	53	When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	38	53	Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	39	53	Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	40	53	She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	41	53	Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	42	53	Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	43	53	Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	44	53	Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, claiming all will be well in the morning.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	45	53	The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	46	53	They wake the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	47	53	The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	48	53	After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream "past the wit of man".
A Midsummer Night's Dream	49	53	In Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform Pyramus and Thisbe.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	50	53	The performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	51	53	Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune.
A Midsummer Night's Dream	52	53	After all the other characters leave, Puck "restores amends" and suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing more than a dream.
The Apartment	0	39	Calvin Clifford (C) "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in New York City.
The Apartment	1	39	In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers, who reinforce their position over him by regularly calling him "Buddy Boy," to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that he is a playboy bringing home different women every night.
The Apartment	2	39	The four managers (Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, and David White) write glowing reports about Bud, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).
The Apartment	3	39	Sheldrake calls Baxter to his office but says that he has found out why they were so enthusiastic.
The Apartment	4	39	Then he goes on to promote him in return for exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment.
The Apartment	5	39	He insists on using it that same night and, as compensation for such short notice, gives Baxter two company-sponsored tickets to the hit Broadway musical The Music Man.
The Apartment	6	39	After work, Bud catches Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), an elevator operator on whom he has had his eye, and asks her to go to the musical with him.
The Apartment	7	39	They agree to meet at the theater after she has a drink with a former fling.
The Apartment	8	39	The man whom she meets, by coincidence, is Sheldrake, who convinces her that he is about to divorce his wife for her.
The Apartment	9	39	They go to Baxter's apartment as Baxter waits forlornly outside the theater.
The Apartment	10	39	Several weeks later, at the company's raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake's secretary Miss Olsen (Edie Adams), drunkenly reveals to Fran that Fran is just the latest in a string of female employees whom Sheldrake has seduced into affairs with the promise of divorcing his wife, with Miss Olsen herself being one of them.
The Apartment	11	39	At Bud's apartment, Fran confronts Sheldrake, upset with herself for believing his lies.
The Apartment	12	39	Sheldrake maintains that he genuinely loves her but then leaves to return to his suburban family as usual.
The Apartment	13	39	Meanwhile, Bud accidentally finds out about Sheldrake and Fran.
The Apartment	14	39	Heartbroken, he lets himself be picked up by a woman (Hope Holiday) at a local bar.
The Apartment	15	39	When they arrive at his apartment, he is shocked to find Fran in his bed, fully clothed and unconscious from an intentional overdose of his sleeping pills.
The Apartment	16	39	He enlists the help of his neighbor, dr Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), to revive Fran without notifying the authorities and sends his confused bar pickup home.
The Apartment	17	39	To protect his job, he lets Dreyfuss believe that he and Fran are lovers who had fought, which he took so lightly that he was meeting another woman while she was attempting suicide.
The Apartment	18	39	This comes as no surprise to dr Dreyfuss or his wife, who long assumed Baxter was a womanizing playboy from all the noise coming from his apartment at all hours.
The Apartment	19	39	Fran spends two days recuperating at his apartment, while Bud tries entertaining and distracting her from any further suicidal thoughts, talking her into playing numerous hands of gin rummy.
The Apartment	20	39	Since she has been missing, Fran's brother-in-law Karl Matuschka (Johnny Seven) comes to the office looking for her.
The Apartment	21	39	She has not been there and neither has Baxter.
The Apartment	22	39	The previous day, one of the executives had seen Fran in the bedroom when he came to the apartment hoping to borrow it, and mentioned it to the other executives.
The Apartment	23	39	Resenting Bud for denying them access to his apartment, the executives direct the man there.
The Apartment	24	39	Baxter again takes responsibility for Fran's actions, and Karl punches him twice in the face.

The World According to Garp	0	24	The story deals with the life of Garp.

The World According to Garp	2	24	She encounters a dying ball turret gunner known only as Technical Sergeant Garp, who was severely brain damaged in combat.
The World According to Garp	3	24	Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual autonomic sexual arousal.
The World According to Garp	4	24	As a matter of practicality and kindness in making his passing as comfortable as possible and reducing his agitation, she manually gratifies him several times.
The World According to Garp	5	24	Unconstrained by convention and driven by practicality and her desire for a child, Jenny rapes Technical Sergeant Garp, and uses his semen to impregnate herself and names the resulting son "T".
The World According to Garp	6	24	(a name derived from "Technical Sergeant", but consisting of just initials).
The World According to Garp	7	24	Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position at the all-boys Steering School in New England.
The World According to Garp	8	24	Garp grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction&mdash;three topics in which his mother has little interest.
The World According to Garp	9	24	After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to Vienna, where he writes his first novella.
The World According to Garp	10	24	At the same time, his mother begins writing her autobiography, A Sexual Suspect.
The World According to Garp	11	24	After Jenny and Garp return to Steering, Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach's daughter, and begins his family‚Äîhe a struggling writer, she a teacher of English.
The World According to Garp	12	24	The publication of A Sexual Suspect makes his mother famous.
The World According to Garp	13	24	She becomes a feminist icon, as feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man, and who chooses to raise a child on her own.
The World According to Garp	14	24	She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men, among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut off by her rapists to silence her.
The World According to Garp	15	24	The members of the group cut off their own tongues in support of the girl.

The World According to Garp	18	24	Garp learns (often painfully) from the women in his life (including transsexual ex-football player Roberta Muldoon), who are struggling to become more tolerant in the face of intolerance.
The World According to Garp	19	24	The story contains a great deal of (in the words of Garp's fictional teacher) "lunacy and sorrow", and the sometimes ridiculous chains of events the characters experience still resonate with painful truth.
The World According to Garp	20	24	The novel contains several framed narratives: Garp's first novella, The Pension Grillparzer; "Vigilance", a short story; and the first chapter of his novel, The World According to Bensenhaver.
The World According to Garp	21	24	The book also contains some motifs that appear in almost all John Irving novels: bears, New England, Vienna, wrestling, people who are uninterested in having sex, and a complex Dickensian plot that spans the protagonist's whole life.
The World According to Garp	22	24	Adultery (another common Irving motif) also plays a large part, culminating in one of the novel's most harrowing and memorable scenes.
The World According to Garp	23	24	Another familiar Irving trope, castration anxiety, is present, most obviously in the fate of one character, Michael Milton.

Coming to America	13	22	mr McDowell, initially disapproving of the match as he did not want to see his daughter with a man of poor means, is ecstatic that she has in fact attracted the interest of an extremely wealthy prince, but Lisa becomes angry and confused as to why Akeem lied to her about his identity, as he had told her before that he was actually a Zamundan goat herder.
Coming to America	14	22	Still hurt and angry that Akeem lied to her, she refuses to marry him, even after he offers to renounce his throne, and he returns home with a broken heart, resigned to marry the woman chosen for him by his parents.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	5	47	The brothers have been named alphabetically from the Old Testament in order of birth: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for frankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	6	47	All of the brothers have red hair and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	7	47	Milly teaches Adam's rowdy, ill-behaved younger brothers manners and social mores.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	8	47	She also shows them how to dance.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	9	47	At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their "mountain man" ways, but eventually each comes to see that the only way he will get a woman of his own is to do things Milly's way.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	11	47	The girls take a fancy to the brothers as well.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	14	47	Adam refuses to let himself be pushed around by the rival suitors and calls his younger brothers cowards for letting them get away with their behavior.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	15	47	The girls' suitors from the town finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking Gideon into fighting back.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	16	47	A free-for-all ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker townie rivals.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	20	47	Adam reads his brothers the story of "The Sobbin' Women" (taken from Plutarch's story of the Sabine Women), one of the books Milly brought to the homestead.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	21	47	He tells them that they should stop moping around and take whatever action is necessary to get their women.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	22	47	Aided by Adam, the brothers kidnap the six girls, then cause an avalanche in Echo Pass so that they cannot be followed by the townspeople.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	23	47	The only problem: they forgot to bring the parson to perform the marriages.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	28	47	The winter months slowly pass.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	31	47	Milly gives birth to a daughter, Hannah.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	32	47	Gideon rides to the cabin to inform Adam of his daughter's arrival and asks him to come home.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	33	47	Adam refuses, saying that he had said he would return home only when the snow had melted enough that the pass was open to traffic.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	34	47	Having time to think about his baby daughter, Adam returns home in the spring just as Echo Pass is opening and reconciles with Milly.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	35	47	As a newly responsible father, he has become aware of how worried the townspeople would be about what has happened to the six abducted girls.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	36	47	Adam realizes he was wrong to tell his brothers to kidnap them.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	37	47	He tells his brothers they need to take the women back to their homes in town, but his brothers are unwilling.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	38	47	The six women also do not want to return to their homes; they all want to stay at the farm with their new suitors and hide so they will not be taken back home.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	39	47	When Milly discovers that the women are not in the house, Adam tells his brothers to go after them and bring them back.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	40	47	The townspeople arrive with the intention of lynching the Pontipee brothers for the kidnappings.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	41	47	Upon finding the brothers trying to force the women to return, the fathers believe their daughters are being assaulted and charge to their rescue.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	42	47	Alice's father (Ian Wolfe), a preacher, hears baby Hannah cry in the distance, and worries that the baby might belong to one of the kidnapped girls.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	43	47	The fathers and other townsmen round up the Pontipees and announce they intend to hang them.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	44	47	Alice's father, the Reverend Alcott, asks the women whose baby he had heard.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	45	47	They all decide, simultaneously, to claim the baby as their own.
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers	46	47	This misinformation gives the women and the brothers their wish: the townspeople, including the girls' fathers, insist that all six couples marry at once in a shotgun wedding, performed by the parson while Adam and Milly watch and the fathers stand behind their daughters' grooms, shotguns over their arms.

Cinderella	0	98	Giambattista Basile, an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled Lo cunto de li cunti (The Story of Stories), or Pentamerone.
Cinderella	1	98	It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper.
Cinderella	2	98	It was published posthumously in 1634.
Cinderella	3	98	Plot: One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon.
Cinderella	4	98	The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of "glass" slippers.
Cinderella	5	98	Plot:  The first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.
Cinderella	6	98	Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.
Cinderella	7	98	However, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That "without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense.
Cinderella	8	98	These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them.
Cinderella	9	98	However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother".
Cinderella	10	98	Another well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century.
Cinderella	11	98	The tale is called "Aschenputtel" ("Cinderella" in English translations).
Cinderella	12	98	This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the step sisters cut off their own toes to fit in the golden slipper.
Cinderella	13	98	In addition, there is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that she planted on her mother's grave.
Cinderella	14	98	Plot:  Aschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; Perrault's version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter.
Cinderella	15	98	However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child.
Cinderella	16	98	He also describes Aschenputtel as his "first wife's child" and not his own.
Cinderella	17	98	Villains: In some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular Disney film, Cinderella's father has died and Cinderella's mother has died also.
Cinderella	18	98	Although many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in Fair, Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron, the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen.
Cinderella	19	98	In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her.
Cinderella	20	98	Of this type (510B) are Cap O' Rushes, Catskin, All-Kinds-of-Fur, and Allerleirauh, and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.
Cinderella	21	98	In Katie Woodencloak, the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.
Cinderella	22	98	In La Cenerentola, Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her stepfather.
Cinderella	23	98	(This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.
Cinderella	24	98	Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.
Cinderella	25	98	Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew: The number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three.
Cinderella	26	98	The fairy godmother is Perrault's own addition to the tale.
Cinderella	27	98	The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms's version is her dead mother.
Cinderella	28	98	Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing.
Cinderella	29	98	Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball.
Cinderella	30	98	This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as The Cinder Maid, collected by Joseph Jacobs, and the Finnish The Wonderful Birch.
Cinderella	31	98	Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods.
Cinderella	32	98	Giambattista Basile's Cenerentola combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing.
Cinderella	33	98	Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, The Story of Tam and Cam, or The Sharp Grey Sheep‚Äîthese animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in The Golden Slipper, a fish aids her after she puts it in water.
Cinderella	34	98	In "The Anklet", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball.
Cinderella	35	98	Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola, in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.
Cinderella	36	98	The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired.
Cinderella	37	98	In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.
Cinderella	38	98	Furthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as Katie Woodencloak and The Golden Slipper have her attend church.
Cinderella	39	98	In the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty.
Cinderella	40	98	However, on the third (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes.
Cinderella	41	98	In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds‚Äîor else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.
Cinderella	42	98	The identifying item: The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault's version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: Aschenbroedel and Aschenputtel, for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity.
Cinderella	43	98	In Rossini's opera "La Cenerentola" ("Cinderella"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity.
Cinderella	44	98	In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers.
Cinderella	45	98	Interpreters unaware of the value attached to glass in 17th century France and perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's "glass slipper" (pantoufle de verre) had been a "squirrel fur slipper" (pantoufle de vair) in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.
Cinderella	46	98	The 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.
Cinderella	47	98	Another interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element‚Äîthe Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a 'Droit du seigneur' right of sexual possession of his subjects.
Cinderella	48	98	The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).
Cinderella	49	98	The translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason.
Cinderella	50	98	Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone.
Cinderella	51	98	In Terry Pratchett's Witches Abroad, the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her.
Cinderella	52	98	In "When the Clock Strikes" (from Red As Blood), Tanith Lee had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.
Cinderella	53	98	The Revelation: Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.
Cinderella	54	98	In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother.
Cinderella	55	98	The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.
Cinderella	56	98	In many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged.
Cinderella	57	98	Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters.
Cinderella	58	98	In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.
Cinderella	59	98	The prince nevertheless insists on her trying.
Cinderella	60	98	Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).
Cinderella	61	98	The Conclusion: In the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds.
Cinderella	62	98	In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.
Cinderella	63	98	In The Thousand Nights and A Night, in a tale called "The Anklet", the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night.
Cinderella	64	98	In The Wonderful Birch, the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth.
Cinderella	65	98	Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.
Cinderella	66	98	In an episode of Jim Henson's The Storyteller, writer Anthony Minghella merged the old folk tale Donkeyskin (also written by Perrault) with Cinderella to tell the tale of Sapsorrow, a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.
Cinderella	67	98	Many popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other.
Cinderella	68	98	Examples are the film Ever After, Cinderella 3 and the Broadway revival.
Cinderella	69	98	Ever After (known in promotional material as Ever After: A Cinderella Story) is a 1998 American romantic comedy-drama film inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella, directed by Andy Tennant and starring Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott.
Cinderella	70	98	The usual pantomime and comic/supernatural elements are removed and the story is instead treated as historical fiction, set in Renaissance-era France.
Cinderella	71	98	It is often seen as a modern, post-feminism interpretation of the Cinderella myth.
Cinderella	72	98	There is also Gregory Maguire's novel Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, which gives the classic story from the view of one of the ugly stepsisters.
Cinderella	73	98	In this version, the Cinderella character is unusually beautiful, but also a shy enigma.
Cinderella	74	98	Her stepsister, though plain, is charming and intelligent.
Cinderella	75	98	The novel has themes much more adult than the traditional story.
Cinderella	76	98	Likewise there is a Marissa Meyer novel Cinder, which is set in a futuristic Beijing.
Cinderella	77	98	The Cinderella character, named Cinder, is a cyborg mechanic, who meets Prince Kaito.
Cinderella	78	98	Gail Carson Levine wrote Ella Enchanted, a story about how "Ella" is under a fairy curse of obedience (she does whatever someone tells her to).
Cinderella	79	98	A movie also has been made based on this book.
Cinderella	80	98	In 1982, Roald Dahl rewrote the story in a more modern and gruesome way in his book Revolting Rhymes.
Cinderella	81	98	In his book dr Gardner's Fairy Tales for Today's Children, dr Richard Gardener's story "Cinderelma" has the heroine Cinderelma and the prince re-unite, then mutually decide to separate.
Cinderella	82	98	Cinderelma then gets a job as a seamstress, later opens her own dress shop, and marries a young printer who owns the shop next door to hers.
Cinderella	83	98	In 1995, Richard Conlon's play Anastasia and Drizella was produced at Chicago's Temporary Theatre.
Cinderella	84	98	In it, Cinderella's step sister Anastasia gets a master's degree in finance, and her step sister Drizella gets a master's degree in chemical engineering.
Cinderella	85	98	When the prince tries to have Cinderella's step family beheaded, Anastasia buys the kingdom.
Cinderella	86	98	The prince and Cinderella get married, and spend the rest of their lives working as servants for Cinderella's step family, while the step sisters live happily ever after.
Cinderella	87	98	In the 2005 picture book Ella's Big Chance by Shirley Hughes, Ella is a dressmaker in her father's shop, and when the stepsisters arrive they appoint themselves as models.
Cinderella	88	98	Ella eventually chooses to marry Buttons, an employee in the shop, instead of the prince.
Cinderella	89	98	In Emily Short's 2006 interactive fiction short story Glass, it is Cinderella herself who has magical powers, and neither her stepmother nor her stepsisters are malicious.
Cinderella	90	98	The royal ambitions of the stepmother plays a small part in their attempt to deceive the prince, but more importantly they are trying to protect Cinderella from the law of the land, under which practicing magic is punishable by death.
Cinderella	91	98	In 2014, Bad Wolf Press published a musical version called Cinderella: A Modern Makeover, a fractured interpretation of the story featuring a more positive "blended family" home life as well as a heroine trying to get her dream job at the palace instead of a marriage proposal.
Cinderella	92	98	Also in 2014, Rae Magdon published an unusual retelling of the story in a novel titled The Second Sister, in which the protagonist, Ellie, is somewhat forced into stopping one of her step-sisters from enchanting the Prince and take over the entire Kingdom.
Cinderella	93	98	In order to do this, she receives the help of a shy maid, a friendly cook, a talking cat, and her mysterious second sister.
Cinderella	94	98	Anne Sexton wrote an adaptation as a poem called "Cinderella" in her collection Transformations (1971), a book in which she re-envisions sixteen of the Grimm's Fairy tales.
Cinderella	95	98	The Throne of Glass series, written by Sarah Maas, is inspired by the story of Cinderella.

The Mexican	0	32	The story follows Jerry Welbach as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States.
The Mexican	1	32	Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese, who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk.
The Mexican	2	32	In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman.
The Mexican	3	32	Retrieving the gun will be his final errand.

The Mexican	6	32	There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire.
The Mexican	7	32	Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival.
The Mexican	8	32	Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside.
The Mexican	9	32	Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck.

The Mexican	12	32	They pick up a postal worker named Frank, who then has a relationship with Leroy.
The Mexican	13	32	Another hitman follows them to Las Vegas and kills Frank to make it look like a suicide.
The Mexican	14	32	Leroy kills him in an act of vengeance, and flees with Samantha.
The Mexican	15	32	Jerry finds out that Ted, his friend and colleague, wanted to kill him and take the pistol to Margolese, but hesitated and ends up getting handcuffed to a pawnshop owner, after he received the gun from a policeman when Jerry was being interrogated for the bloodstain on the front passenger seat of his car.
The Mexican	16	32	Jerry then finds out he accidentally grabbed Ted's Passport and tries to retrieve his own, but Ted has already fled.

The Mexican	20	32	Samantha begins to realize that Leroy was not who he appeared to be when they first met.
The Mexican	21	32	Jerry realizes that Nayman's plan was to make it look like Jerry double crossed Margolese.
The Mexican	22	32	Shocked by this, Samantha decides to go home, but also decides to stay with Jerry to see the situation to the end.
The Mexican	23	32	Jerry gets assaulted and taken to Margolese who was released from prison a few days earlier.
The Mexican	24	32	He tells Jerry that he didn't double cross him as it was Bernie who wanted to sell the pistol to the highest bidder.
The Mexican	25	32	A gunsmith, who is the great-grandson of the gunsmith from the story, wanted to bring the pistol back to where it belongs.
The Mexican	26	32	He thanks Jerry for risking his life for the pistol he was going to give to his greedy boss.

My Man Godfrey	39	46	He gives the endorsed stock certificates to the stunned mr Bullock, saving the family.

Tootsie	0	31	Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a respected but perfectionist actor.
Tootsie	1	31	Nobody in New York wants to hire him anymore because he is difficult to work with.
Tootsie	2	31	According to his long-suffering agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack), Michael's attention to detail and difficult reputation led a commercial he worked on to run significantly over-schedule, because the idea of a tomato sitting down was "illogical" to him.
Tootsie	3	31	After many months without a job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime soap opera Southwest General from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester (Teri Garr), who tries out for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly, but doesn't get it.
Tootsie	4	31	In desperation, and as a result of his agent telling him that "no one will hire you", he dresses as a woman, auditions as "Dorothy Michaels" and gets the part.
Tootsie	5	31	Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play, written by his roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray) and to star Sandy, titled Return to Love Canal.
Tootsie	6	31	Michael plays his character as a feisty, feminist administrator, which surprises the other actors and crew who expected Emily to be (as written) another swooning female in the plot.
Tootsie	7	31	His character quickly becomes a television sensation.
Tootsie	8	31	When Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed (he wanted to try on her clothes in order to get more ideas for Dorothy's outfits), he covers up by professing he wants to have sex with her.
Tootsie	9	31	They have sex despite his better judgment about her self-esteem issues.
Tootsie	10	31	Michael believes Sandy is too emotionally fragile to handle the truth about him winning the part, especially after noticing her strong resentment of Dorothy.
Tootsie	11	31	Their relationship, combined with his deception, complicates his now-busy schedule.
Tootsie	12	31	Exacerbating matters further, he is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), a single mother in an unhealthy relationship with the show's amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman).
Tootsie	13	31	At a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line that she had previously told Dorothy she would be receptive towards, she throws a drink in his face.
Tootsie	14	31	Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie‚Äîhaving just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy's advice‚Äîconfesses that she has feelings about Dorothy which confuse her, but is not emotionally ready to be in a romantic relationship with a woman.
Tootsie	15	31	Meanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn (George Gaynes) and Julie's widowed father Les (Charles Durning).
Tootsie	16	31	Les proposes marriage, insisting Michael/Dorothy "think about it" before answering; he leaves immediately and returns home to find co-star John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them.
Tootsie	17	31	John apologizes for intruding and leaves.
Tootsie	18	31	The tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy's popularity, the show's producers want to extend her contract for another year.
Tootsie	19	31	Michael finds a clever way to extricate himself.
Tootsie	20	31	When the cast is forced to perform the show live, he improvises a grand speech on camera, pulls off his wig and reveals that he is actually the character's twin brother who took her place to avenge her.
Tootsie	21	31	Sandy and Les, who are all watching at home, react with the same level of shock as the cast and crew of the show.
Tootsie	22	31	The one exception is Jeff, who was aware of his roommate's "dual role" and remarks, "That is one nutty hospital.
Tootsie	23	31	" The revelation allows everybody a more-or-less graceful way out.
Tootsie	24	31	Julie, however, is so outraged that she slugs him in the stomach in front of the cast once the cameras have stopped rolling before storming off.
Tootsie	25	31	Some weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff's play.
Tootsie	26	31	He awkwardly makes peace with Les in a bar, and Les shows tentative support for Michael's attraction to Julie.
Tootsie	27	31	Later, Michael waits for Julie outside the studio.
Tootsie	28	31	Julie resists talking but finally admits she misses Dorothy.
Tootsie	29	31	Michael confesses, "I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man".
Tootsie	30	31	At that, she forgives him and they walk off, Julie asking him to lend her a dress.

Hannah and Her Sisters	0	33	The story is told in three main arcs, with most of it occurring during a 24-month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties hosted by Hannah (Mia Farrow) and her husband, Elliot (Michael Caine).
Hannah and Her Sisters	1	33	Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.
Hannah and Her Sisters	2	33	Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee (Barbara Hershey), and eventually begins an affair with her.
Hannah and Her Sisters	3	33	Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.
Hannah and Her Sisters	4	33	Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick (Max von Sydow), who is much older.
Hannah and Her Sisters	5	33	She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.
Hannah and Her Sisters	6	33	She leaves Frederick after he discovers her affair with Elliot.
Hannah and Her Sisters	7	33	For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.
Hannah and Her Sisters	8	33	Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.

Hannah and Her Sisters	15	33	His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness.
Hannah and Her Sisters	16	33	Ultimately, an unsuccessful suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup in a movie theater.
Hannah and Her Sisters	17	33	The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love.
Hannah and Her Sisters	18	33	Holly's story is the film's third main arc.
Hannah and Her Sisters	19	33	A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.

Hannah and Her Sisters	23	33	The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.
Hannah and Her Sisters	24	33	She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.
Hannah and Her Sisters	25	33	It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).
Hannah and Her Sisters	26	33	Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.
Hannah and Her Sisters	27	33	Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date.
Hannah and Her Sisters	28	33	A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma (Maureen O'Sullivan) and Evan (Lloyd Nolan).
Hannah and Her Sisters	29	33	They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.
Hannah and Her Sisters	30	33	Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings.
Hannah and Her Sisters	31	33	By the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married someone she met while taking classes at Columbia, while Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.
Hannah and Her Sisters	32	33	The film's final shot reveals that Holly is married to Mickey and that she is pregnant.
A Room with a View	0	64	The first part of the novel is set in Florence, Italy, and describes a young English woman's first visit to Florence, at a time when upper middle class English women were starting to lead independent, adventurous lives.
A Room with a View	1	64	Lucy Honeychurch is touring Italy with her overbearing older cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett, and the novel opens with their complaints about the hotel, "The Pension Bertolini".
A Room with a View	2	64	Their primary concern is that although rooms with a view of the River Arno have been promised for each of them, their rooms instead look over a courtyard.
A Room with a View	3	64	A mr Emerson interrupts their "peevish wrangling," offering to swap rooms as he and his son, George Emerson, look over the Arno.
A Room with a View	4	64	This behaviour causes Miss Bartlett some consternation, as it appears impolite.
A Room with a View	5	64	Without letting Lucy speak, Miss Bartlett refuses the offer, looking down on the Emersons because of their unconventional behaviour and thinking it would place her under an "unseemly obligation" towards them.
A Room with a View	6	64	However, another guest at the pension, an Anglican clergyman named mr Beebe, persuades the pair to accept the offer, assuring Miss Bartlett that mr Emerson only meant to be kind.
A Room with a View	7	64	The next day, while Charlotte rests in the pension, Lucy decides to spend a "long morning" in the Basilica of Santa Croce, led by another guest, Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who promises her an adventure.
A Room with a View	8	64	The older woman immediately takes away Lucy's Baedeker guidebook, which, she says, only touches the surface of things.
A Room with a View	9	64	She will show Lucy the "true Italy".
A Room with a View	10	64	But on the way to Santa Croce, chattering away, the two take a wrong turn and get lost.
A Room with a View	11	64	After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas, they finally make it back to the square in front of the church only to have the novelist abandon Lucy in pursuit of an old man who, she says, is her "local colour box".
A Room with a View	12	64	Inside the church, Lucy meets the Emersons again.
A Room with a View	13	64	Although their manners are awkward and they are deemed socially unacceptable by the other guests, Lucy likes them and continues to run into them in Florence.
A Room with a View	14	64	One afternoon Lucy witnesses a murder in Florence.
A Room with a View	15	64	George Emerson happens to be nearby and catches her when she faints.
A Room with a View	16	64	Lucy asks George to retrieve some photographs of hers that happen to be near the murder site.
A Room with a View	17	64	George, out of confusion, throws her photographs into the river because they were spotted with blood.
A Room with a View	18	64	Lucy observes how boyish George is.
A Room with a View	19	64	As they stop to look over the River Arno before making their way back to the hotel, they have an intimate conversation.
A Room with a View	20	64	After this, Lucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings and partly to keep her cousin happy‚ÄîMiss Bartlett is wary of the eccentric Emersons, particularly after a comment made by another clergyman, mr Eager, that mr Emerson "murdered his wife in the sight of God".
A Room with a View	21	64	Later on in the week, a party made up of Beebe, Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Miss Bartlett and Lucy Honeychurch make their way to Fiesole, in carriages driven by Italians.
A Room with a View	22	64	The driver is permitted to invite a woman he claims is his sister onto the box of the carriage, and when he kisses her, mr Eager promptly forces the lady to get off the carriage box.
A Room with a View	23	64	mr Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love.
A Room with a View	24	64	In the fields, Lucy searches for mr Beebe, and asks in poor Italian for the driver to show her the way.
A Room with a View	25	64	Misunderstanding, he leads her to a field where George stands.
A Room with a View	26	64	George is overcome by Lucy's beauty among a field of violets and kisses her, but they are interrupted by Lucy's cousin, who is outraged.
A Room with a View	27	64	Lucy promises Miss Bartlett that she will not tell her mother of the "insult" George has paid her because Miss Bartlett fears she will be blamed.
A Room with a View	28	64	The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy is able to say goodbye to George.
A Room with a View	29	64	In Rome, Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England.
A Room with a View	30	64	Cecil proposes to Lucy twice in Italy; she rejects him both times.
A Room with a View	31	64	As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned to Surrey, England to her family home, Windy Corner.
A Room with a View	32	64	Cecil proposes yet again at Windy Corner, and this time she accepts.
A Room with a View	33	64	Cecil is a sophisticated and "superior" Londoner who is desirable in terms of rank and class, even though he despises country society; he is also somewhat of a comic figure in the novel, as he gives himself airs and is quite pretentious.
A Room with a View	34	64	The vicar, mr Beebe, announces that new tenants have leased a local cottage; the new arrivals turn out to be the Emersons, who have been told of the available cottage at a chance meeting with Cecil; the young man brought them to the village as a comeuppance to the cottage's landlord, whom Cecil thinks to be a snob.
A Room with a View	35	64	Fate takes an ironic turn as Lucy's brother, Freddy, meets George and invites him to bathe in a nearby pond.
A Room with a View	36	64	Freddy, George and Mr Beebe go to the pond, in the woods, take off their clothes and swim.
A Room with a View	37	64	They enjoy themselves so much they end up running around the pond and through the bushes, until Lucy, her mother, and Cecil arrive, having taken a short-cut through the woods.
A Room with a View	38	64	Freddy later invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner.
A Room with a View	39	64	Although Lucy is initially mortified at the thought of facing both George and Cecil (who is also visiting Windy Corner that Sunday), she resolves to be gracious.
A Room with a View	40	64	Cecil annoys everyone by pacing around and reading aloud from a light romance novel that contains a scene suspiciously reminiscent of when George kissed Lucy in Florence.
A Room with a View	41	64	George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again.
A Room with a View	42	64	Lucy realises that the novel is by Miss Lavish (the writer-acquaintance from Florence) and that Charlotte must thus have told her about the kiss.
A Room with a View	43	64	Furious with Charlotte for betraying her secret, Lucy forces her cousin to watch as she tells George to leave and never return.
A Room with a View	44	64	George argues with her, saying that Cecil only sees her as an "object for the shelf" and will never love her enough to grant her independence, while George loves her for who she is.
A Room with a View	45	64	Lucy is moved but remains firm.
A Room with a View	46	64	Later that evening, after Cecil again rudely declines to play tennis, Lucy sours on Cecil and immediately breaks off her engagement.
A Room with a View	47	64	She decides to flee to Greece with acquaintances from her trip to Florence, but shortly before her departure she accidentally encounters mr Emerson senior.
A Room with a View	48	64	He is not aware that Lucy has broken her engagement with Cecil, and Lucy cannot lie to the old man.
A Room with a View	49	64	mr Emerson forces Lucy to admit out loud that she has been in love with his son George all along.
A Room with a View	50	64	The novel ends in Florence, in melodramatic fashion, where George and Lucy have eloped without her mother's consent.
A Room with a View	51	64	Although Lucy "had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever," the story ends with the promise of lifelong love for both her and George.
A Room with a View	52	64	In some editions, an appendix to the novel is given entitled "A View without a Room," written by Forster in 1958 as to what occurred between Lucy and George after the events of the novel.
A Room with a View	53	64	It is Forster's afterthought of the novel, and he quite clearly states that "I cannot think where George and Lucy live".
A Room with a View	54	64	They were quite comfortable up until the end of World War I, with Charlotte Bartlett leaving them all her money in her will, but the war ruined their happiness according to Forster.
A Room with a View	55	64	George became a conscientious objector, lost his government job but was given non-combatant duties to avoid prison, leaving Mrs Honeychurch deeply upset with her son-in-law.
A Room with a View	56	64	Mr Emerson died during the course of the war, shortly after having an argument with the police about Lucy continuing to play Beethoven (a German composer) on the piano during the war.
A Room with a View	57	64	Eventually they had three children, two girls and a boy, and moved to Carshalton from Highgate to find a home.
A Room with a View	58	64	Despite their wanting to move into Windy Corner after the death of Mrs Honeychurch, Freddy sold the house to support his family as he was "an unsuccessful but prolific doctor".
A Room with a View	59	64	After the outbreak of World War II, George immediately enlisted as he saw the need to stop Hitler and the Nazi regime, but was not faithful to Lucy during his time at war.
A Room with a View	60	64	Lucy was left homeless after her flat in Watford was bombed and the same happened to her married daughter in Nuneaton.
A Room with a View	61	64	George rose to the rank of corporal but was taken prisoner by the Italians in Africa.
A Room with a View	62	64	Once the Fascist government in Italy fell, George returned to Florence finding it "in a mess" but he was unable to find the Pension Bertolini, stating "the View was still there and that the room must be there, too, but could not be found".
A Room with a View	63	64	Forster ends by stating that George and Lucy await World War III, but with no word on where they live, for even he does not know.
Moonstruck	0	42	Thirty-seven-year-old Loretta Castorini (Cher), a Sicilian-American widow, is a bookkeeper in Brooklyn Heights, New York, where she lives with her family: her father Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) a successful plumber; her mother Rose (Olympia Dukakis); and her paternal grandfather (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr).
Moonstruck	1	42	Her boyfriend Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to be with his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death.
Moonstruck	2	42	Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding.
Moonstruck	3	42	Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement.
Moonstruck	4	42	Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the "real" wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves.
Moonstruck	5	42	The next day, Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery.
Moonstruck	6	42	He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fianc√©e; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fianc√©e left him.
Moonstruck	7	42	Loretta insists that they discuss the matter upstairs in his apartment, where she cooks for him and then tells him that she believes he is a "wolf" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship.
Moonstruck	8	42	Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then carrying her to his bed where they make love.
Moonstruck	9	42	At the same time, Cosmo is dining with his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette) and giving her jewelry.
Moonstruck	10	42	That evening, Rose's brother Raymond (Louis Guss) and his wife Rita (Julie Bovasso) join Rose and Cosmo for dinner, and they all wonder where Loretta is.
Moonstruck	11	42	Raymond recalls that when he was a boy and Cosmo was courting Rose, he thought that a particularly bright moon one night was somehow brought to the house by Cosmo because of his love for Rose.
Moonstruck	12	42	That night, Loretta remains at Ronny's apartment and sees such a moon; Raymond sees it as well, and it leads him and Rita to make love.
Moonstruck	13	42	The next morning, Loretta tells Ronny they can never see each other again.
Moonstruck	14	42	She slaps him when he claims to be in love with her ("Snap out of it.
Moonstruck	15	42	") and he agrees to never see her again if she will attend the opera (his other great love) with him that night.
Moonstruck	16	42	She agrees.
Moonstruck	17	42	She then goes to church and confesses her infidelity.
Moonstruck	18	42	She unexpectedly sees her mother there, and Rose tells her that Cosmo is having an affair; Loretta is doubtful.
Moonstruck	19	42	Loretta then goes to Raymond and Rita's store to close out the cash register, after which she impulsively goes to the hair salon and buys a glamorous evening gown.
Moonstruck	20	42	Loretta and Ronny (wearing a tuxedo) meet at Lincoln Center, and each is impressed with the other's appearance.
Moonstruck	21	42	Loretta is deeply moved by her first opera, Puccini's La boh√®me.
Moonstruck	22	42	But as they leave, Loretta sees Cosmo and Mona, and she confronts her father.
Moonstruck	23	42	He sees that she is with Ronny, and he suggests that they simply agree that they didn't see each other at all, but Loretta is conflicted.
Moonstruck	24	42	Loretta then intends to return home alone, but Ronny leads her back to his apartment where he passionately and desperately persuades her into another tryst.
Moonstruck	25	42	The same night, Rose dines alone at a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry (John Mahoney), being dramatically dumped by a female student, a similar scene having played out with a different girl the night Johnny proposed to Loretta.
Moonstruck	26	42	Rose invites Perry to dine with her, asks him why men pursue women, and then shares with him her belief that men pursue women because they fear death.
Moonstruck	27	42	Perry walks Rose home and tries to convince her to invite him in; she refuses "because I'm married.
Moonstruck	28	42	Because I know who I am".
Moonstruck	29	42	Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother's "miraculous" recovery and goes to Loretta's house; Rose explains that she's not there and then asks him why men chase women.
Moonstruck	30	42	He tells her it may be because they fear death, with which Rose agrees.
Moonstruck	31	42	After this exchange he leaves, planning to return in the morning to see Loretta.
Moonstruck	32	42	In the morning, Loretta returns home in a reverie but is then distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be there soon.
Moonstruck	33	42	Ronny then arrives, and Rose notes their matching "love bites" and invites him for breakfast over Loretta's objections.
Moonstruck	34	42	Cosmo and his father emerge from upstairs, and the older man cajoles Cosmo into agreeing to pay for Loretta's wedding.
Moonstruck	35	42	Rose then confronts Cosmo and, after he acknowledges in response to her questioning that she has been a good wife, demands that he end his affair; he is upset but agrees and, after insistence from Rose, also agrees to go to confession, and they then affirm their love for each other.
Moonstruck	36	42	Raymond and Rita also arrive, concerned and seemingly reluctantly suspicious, to find out why Loretta didn't make the previous day's bank deposit; they are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money.
Moonstruck	37	42	When Johnny finally arrives, he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother's death.
Moonstruck	38	42	Loretta, momentarily offended by his breaking the engagement, chastises Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him.
Moonstruck	39	42	Seizing the moment, Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him; she accepts.
Moonstruck	40	42	To Rose's chagrin, Loretta declares that she loves Ronny.
Moonstruck	41	42	The family toasts the couple with champagne and a befuddled Johnny joins in at the grandfather's urging, as he will now be part of the family after all.

Anna Karenina	2	154	A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry her if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin, a senior government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, and Karenin's indecision.

Anna Karenina	9	154	The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately thousand pages.
Anna Karenina	10	154	Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time‚Äîpolitics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.
Anna Karenina	11	154	The novel is divided into eight parts.
Anna Karenina	12	154	Its epigraph is Vengeance is mine, I will repay, from , which in turn quotes from.
Anna Karenina	13	154	The novel begins with one of its most often-quoted lines: The novel opens with a scene that introduces Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky ("Stiva"), a Moscow aristocrat and civil servant who has been unfaithful to his wife Princess Darya Alexandrovna ("Dolly").

Anna Karenina	29	154	Vronsky has been paying her considerable attention, and she expects to dance with him at a ball that evening.
Anna Karenina	30	154	Kitty is very struck by Anna's beauty and personality and becomes infatuated with her just as Vronsky is.
Anna Karenina	31	154	When Levin proposes to Kitty at her home, she clumsily turns him down, believing she is in love with Vronsky and that he will propose to her, and encouraged to do so by her mother who believes Vronsky would be a better match (in contrast to Kitty's father, who favors Levin).
Anna Karenina	32	154	At the big ball Kitty expects to hear something definitive from Vronsky, but he dances with Anna, choosing her as a partner over a shocked and heartbroken Kitty.
Anna Karenina	33	154	Kitty realizes that Vronsky has fallen in love with Anna and has no intention of marrying her, despite his overt flirtations.
Anna Karenina	34	154	Vronsky has regarded his interactions with Kitty merely as a source of amusement and assumes that Kitty has acted for the same reasons.
Anna Karenina	35	154	Anna, shaken by her emotional and physical response to Vronsky, returns at once to st Petersburg.

Anna Karenina	42	154	The Shcherbatskys consult doctors over Kitty's health, which has been failing since Vronsky's rejection.
Anna Karenina	43	154	A specialist advises that Kitty should go abroad to a health spa to recover.
Anna Karenina	44	154	Dolly speaks to Kitty and understands she is suffering because of Vronsky and Levin, whom she cares for and had hurt in vain.
Anna Karenina	45	154	Kitty, humiliated by Vronsky and tormented by her rejection of Levin, upsets her sister by referring to Stiva's infidelity, saying she could never love a man who betrayed her.
Anna Karenina	46	154	Meanwhile, Stiva visits Levin on his country estate while selling a nearby plot of land.
Anna Karenina	47	154	In st Petersburg, Anna begins to spend more time in the inner circle of Princess Elizaveta ("Betsy"), a fashionable socialite and Vronsky's cousin.
Anna Karenina	48	154	Vronsky continues to pursue Anna.
Anna Karenina	49	154	Although she initially tries to reject him, she eventually succumbs to his attentions.
Anna Karenina	50	154	Karenin reminds his wife of the impropriety of paying too much attention to Vronsky in public, which is becoming the subject of gossip.
Anna Karenina	51	154	He is concerned about the couple's public image, although he believes that Anna is above suspicion.
Anna Karenina	52	154	Vronsky, a keen horseman, takes part in a steeplechase event, during which he rides his mare Frou-Frou too hard‚Äîhis irresponsibility causing her to fall and break her back.
Anna Karenina	53	154	Anna is unable to hide her distress during the accident.
Anna Karenina	54	154	Before this, Anna had told Vronsky that she is pregnant with his child.
Anna Karenina	55	154	Karenin is also present at the races and remarks to Anna that her behaviour is improper.
Anna Karenina	56	154	Anna, in a state of extreme distress and emotion, confesses her affair to her husband.
Anna Karenina	57	154	Karenin asks her to break it off to avoid further gossip, believing that their marriage will be preserved.

Anna Karenina	59	154	There, they meet the wheelchair-bound Pietist Madame Stahl and the saintly Varenka, her adopted daughter.
Anna Karenina	60	154	Influenced by Varenka, Kitty becomes extremely pious, but becomes disillusioned by her father's criticism when she learns Madame Stahl is faking her illness.
Anna Karenina	61	154	She then returns to Moscow.
Anna Karenina	62	154	Levin continues working on his estate, a setting closely tied to his spiritual thoughts and struggles.
Anna Karenina	63	154	He wrestles with the idea of falseness, wondering how he should go about ridding himself of it, and criticising what he feels is falseness in others.
Anna Karenina	64	154	He develops ideas relating to agriculture, and the unique relationship between the agricultural labourer and his native land and culture.
Anna Karenina	65	154	He comes to believe that the agricultural reforms of Europe will not work in Russia because of the unique culture and personality of the Russian peasant.
Anna Karenina	66	154	When Levin visits Dolly, she attempts to understand what happened between him and Kitty and to explain Kitty's behaviour.
Anna Karenina	67	154	Levin is very agitated by Dolly's talk about Kitty, and he begins to feel distant from Dolly as he perceives her loving behaviour towards her children as false.
Anna Karenina	68	154	Levin resolves to forget Kitty and contemplates the possibility of marriage to a peasant woman.
Anna Karenina	69	154	However, a chance sighting of Kitty in her carriage makes Levin realise he still loves her.
Anna Karenina	70	154	Meanwhile, in st Petersburg, Karenin refuses to separate from Anna, insisting that their relationship will continue.
Anna Karenina	71	154	He threatens to take away Seryozha if she persists in her affair with Vronsky.
Anna Karenina	72	154	When Anna and Vronsky continue seeing each other, Karenin consults with a lawyer about obtaining a divorce.
Anna Karenina	73	154	During the time period, a divorce in Russia could only be requested by the innocent party in an affair and required either that the guilty party confessed‚Äîwhich would ruin Anna's position in society and bar her from remarrying in the Orthodox Church‚Äîor that the guilty party be discovered in the act of adultery.
Anna Karenina	74	154	Karenin forces Anna to hand over some of Vronsky's love letters, which the lawyer deems insufficient as proof of the affair.
Anna Karenina	75	154	Stiva and Dolly argue against Karenin's drive for a divorce.
Anna Karenina	76	154	Karenin changes his plans after hearing that Anna is dying after the difficult birth of her daughter, Annie.
Anna Karenina	77	154	At her bedside, Karenin forgives Vronsky.
Anna Karenina	78	154	However, Vronsky, embarrassed by Karenin's magnanimity, unsuccessfully attempts suicide by shooting himself.
Anna Karenina	79	154	As Anna recovers, she finds that she cannot bear living with Karenin despite his forgiveness and his attachment to Annie.
Anna Karenina	80	154	When she hears that Vronsky is about to leave for a military posting in Tashkent, she becomes desperate.
Anna Karenina	81	154	Anna and Vronsky reunite and elope to Europe, leaving Seryozha and Karenin's offer of divorce.
Anna Karenina	82	154	Meanwhile, Stiva acts as a matchmaker with Levin: he arranges a meeting between him and Kitty, which results in their reconciliation and betrothal.
Anna Karenina	83	154	Levin and Kitty marry and start their new life on his country estate.
Anna Karenina	84	154	Although the couple are happy, they undergo a bitter and stressful first three months of marriage.
Anna Karenina	85	154	Levin feels dissatisfied at the amount of time Kitty wants to spend with him and dwells on his inability to be as productive as he was as a bachelor.
Anna Karenina	86	154	When the marriage starts to improve, Levin learns that his brother, Nikolai, is dying of consumption.
Anna Karenina	87	154	Kitty offers to accompany Levin on his journey to see Nikolai and proves herself a great help in nursing Nikolai.
Anna Karenina	88	154	Seeing his wife take charge of the situation in an infinitely more capable manner than if he were without her, Levin's love for Kitty grows.
Anna Karenina	89	154	Kitty eventually learns that she is pregnant.
Anna Karenina	90	154	In Europe, Vronsky and Anna struggle to find friends who will accept them.
Anna Karenina	91	154	Whilst Anna is happy to be finally alone with Vronsky, he feels suffocated.
Anna Karenina	92	154	They cannot socialize with Russians of their own class and find it difficult to amuse themselves.
Anna Karenina	93	154	Vronsky, who believed that being with Anna was the key to his happiness, finds himself increasingly bored and unsatisfied.
Anna Karenina	94	154	He takes up painting and makes an attempt to patronize an √©migr√© Russian artist of genius.
Anna Karenina	95	154	However, Vronsky cannot see that his own art lacks talent and passion, and that his conversation about art is extremely pretentious.
Anna Karenina	96	154	Increasingly restless, Anna and Vronsky decide to return to Russia.
Anna Karenina	97	154	In st Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky stay in one of the best hotels, but take separate suites.
Anna Karenina	98	154	It becomes clear that whilst Vronsky is still able to move freely in Russian society, Anna is barred from it.
Anna Karenina	99	154	Even her old friend, Princess Betsy, who has had affairs herself, evades her company.
Anna Karenina	100	154	Anna starts to become anxious that Vronsky no longer loves her.
Anna Karenina	101	154	Meanwhile, Karenin is comforted by Countess Lidia Ivanovna, an enthusiast of religious and mystic ideas fashionable with the upper classes.
Anna Karenina	102	154	She advises him to keep Seryozha away from Anna and to tell him his mother is dead.
Anna Karenina	103	154	However, Seryozha refuses to believe that this is true.
Anna Karenina	104	154	Anna visits Seryozha uninvited on his ninth birthday but is discovered by Karenin.
Anna Karenina	105	154	Anna, desperate to regain at least some of her former position in society, attends a show at the theatre at which all of st Petersburg's high society are present.
Anna Karenina	106	154	Vronsky begs her not to go, but he is unable to bring himself to explain to her why she cannot attend.
Anna Karenina	107	154	At the theatre, Anna is openly snubbed by her former friends, one of whom makes a deliberate scene and leaves the theatre.
Anna Karenina	108	154	Anna is devastated.
Anna Karenina	109	154	Unable to find a place for themselves in st Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky leave for Vronsky's own country estate.
Anna Karenina	110	154	Dolly, her mother the Princess Scherbatskaya, and Dolly's children spend the summer with Levin and Kitty.
Anna Karenina	111	154	The Levins' life is simple and unaffected, although Levin is uneasy at the "invasion" of so many Scherbatskys.
Anna Karenina	112	154	He becomes extremely jealous when one of the visitors, Veslovsky, flirts openly with the pregnant Kitty.
Anna Karenina	113	154	Levin tries to overcome his feelings, but eventually succumbs to them and makes Veslovsky leave his house in an embarrassing scene.
Anna Karenina	114	154	Veslovsky immediately goes to stay with Anna and Vronsky at their nearby estate.
Anna Karenina	115	154	When Dolly visits Anna, she is struck by the difference between the Levins' aristocratic-yet-simple home life and Vronsky's overtly luxurious and lavish country estate.
Anna Karenina	116	154	She is also unable to keep pace with Anna's fashionable dresses or Vronsky's extravagant spending on a hospital he is building.
Anna Karenina	117	154	In addition, all is not quite well with Anna and Vronsky.
Anna Karenina	118	154	Dolly notices Anna's anxious behaviour and her uncomfortable flirtations with Veslovsky.
Anna Karenina	119	154	Vronsky makes an emotional request to Dolly, asking her to convince Anna to divorce Karenin so that the two might marry and live normally.
Anna Karenina	120	154	Anna has become intensely jealous of Vronsky and cannot bear it when he leaves her even for short excursions.
Anna Karenina	121	154	When Vronsky leaves for several days of provincial elections, Anna becomes convinced that she must marry him to prevent him from leaving her.
Anna Karenina	122	154	After Anna writes to Karenin, she and Vronsky leave the countryside for Moscow.
Anna Karenina	123	154	While visiting Moscow for Kitty's confinement, Levin quickly gets used to the city's fast-paced, expensive and frivolous society life.
Anna Karenina	124	154	He accompanies Stiva to a gentleman's club, where the two meet Vronsky.
Anna Karenina	125	154	Levin and Stiva pay a visit to Anna, who is occupying her empty days by being a patroness to an orphaned English girl.
Anna Karenina	126	154	Levin is initially uneasy about the visit, but Anna easily puts him under her spell.
Anna Karenina	127	154	When he admits to Kitty that he has visited Anna, she accuses him of falling in love with her.
Anna Karenina	128	154	The couple are later reconciled, realising that Moscow society life has had a negative, corrupting effect on Levin.
Anna Karenina	129	154	Anna cannot understand why she can attract a man like Levin, who has a young and beautiful new wife, but can no longer attract Vronsky.
Anna Karenina	130	154	Her relationship with Vronsky is under increasing strain, because he can move freely in Russian society while she remains excluded.
Anna Karenina	131	154	Her increasing bitterness, boredom, and jealousy cause the couple to argue.
Anna Karenina	132	154	Anna uses morphine to help her sleep, a habit she began while living with Vronsky at his country estate.
Anna Karenina	133	154	She has become dependent on it.
Anna Karenina	134	154	Meanwhile, after a long and difficult labour, Kitty gives birth to a son, Dmitri, nicknamed "Mitya".
Anna Karenina	135	154	Levin is both horrified and profoundly moved by the sight of the tiny, helpless baby.
Anna Karenina	136	154	Stiva visits Karenin to seek his commendation for a new post.
Anna Karenina	137	154	During the visit, Stiva asks Karenin to grant Anna a divorce (which would require him to confess to a non-existent affair), but Karenin's decisions are now governed by a French "clairvoyant" recommended by Lidia Ivanovna.
Anna Karenina	138	154	The clairvoyant apparently had a vision in his sleep during Stiva's visit and gives Karenin a cryptic message that he interprets in a way such that he must decline the request for divorce.
Anna Karenina	139	154	Anna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards Vronsky, whom she suspects of having love affairs with other women.
Anna Karenina	140	154	She is also convinced that he will give in to his mother's plans to marry him off to a rich society woman.
Anna Karenina	141	154	They have a bitter row and Anna believes the relationship is over.
Anna Karenina	142	154	She starts to think of suicide as an escape from her torments.
Anna Karenina	143	154	In her mental and emotional confusion, she sends a telegram to Vronsky asking him to come home to her, and then pays a visit to Dolly and Kitty.
Anna Karenina	144	154	Anna's confusion and anger overcome her and, in a parallel to the railway worker's accidental death in Part 1, she commits suicide by throwing herself under the carriage of a passing train.
Anna Karenina	145	154	Sergei Ivanovich's (Levin's brother) latest book is ignored by readers and critics and he joins the new pan-Slavic movement.
Anna Karenina	146	154	Stiva gets the post he desired so much, and Karenin takes custody of Vronsky and Anna's baby, Anna.
Anna Karenina	147	154	A group of Russian volunteers, including the suicidal Vronsky, depart from Russia to fight in the Orthodox Serbian revolt that has broken out against the Turks.
Anna Karenina	148	154	Meanwhile, a lightning storm occurs at Levin's estate while his wife and newborn son are outdoors and, in his fear for their safety, Levin realizes that he does indeed love his son as much as he loves Kitty.
Anna Karenina	149	154	Kitty's family is concerned that a man as altruistic as her husband does not consider himself to be a Christian, but after speaking at length to a peasant, Levin has a true change of heart, concluding that he does believe in the Christian principles taught to him in childhood and no longer questions his faith.
Anna Karenina	150	154	He realizes that one must decide for oneself what is acceptable concerning one's own faith and beliefs.
Anna Karenina	151	154	He chooses not to tell Kitty of the change that he has undergone, and is initially displeased that his return to his faith does not bring with it a complete transformation to righteousness.
Anna Karenina	152	154	However, at the end of the story, Levin arrives at the conclusion that despite his newly accepted beliefs, he is human and will go on making mistakes.
Anna Karenina	153	154	His life can now be meaningfully and truthfully oriented toward righteousness.

Murphy's Romance	1	7	She becomes friends with the town's druggist (pharmacist), Murphy Jones (James Garner), but a romance between them seems unlikely due to Murphy's age and because Emma allows her ex-husband, Bobby Jack Moriarty (Brian Kerwin), to move back in with her and their 12-year-old son, Jake (Corey Haim).

Bruce Almighty	2	32	Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on air.
Bruce Almighty	3	32	Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired.
Bruce Almighty	4	32	Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is "the one who should be fired".
Bruce Almighty	5	32	Bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God.
Bruce Almighty	6	32	God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly.
Bruce Almighty	7	32	God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will.
Bruce Almighty	8	32	Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty training his dog, getting revenge on a street gang that assaulted him earlier, exposing a woman's underwear by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace.
Bruce Almighty	9	32	Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back.
Bruce Almighty	10	32	Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.
Bruce Almighty	11	32	After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor (angering her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head.
Bruce Almighty	12	32	He re-encounters God, who confronts Bruce about his selfish use of his powers.
Bruce Almighty	13	32	He explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them.
Bruce Almighty	14	32	Bruce creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond, but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle ‚Äî even though God had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area ‚Äî and sets the program to automatically answer Yes to every prayer.

Bruce Almighty	16	32	When Grace arrives and sees this, she storms out; Bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him.
Bruce Almighty	17	32	He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will.
Bruce Almighty	18	32	As Bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos.
Bruce Almighty	19	32	Bruce returns to God, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself.
Bruce Almighty	20	32	Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, training his dog normally, and allowing Evan to have his job back.
Bruce Almighty	21	32	Bruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can.
Bruce Almighty	22	32	As he reads through them, he finds a prayer from Grace, wishing for Bruce's success and well being.
Bruce Almighty	23	32	As he reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore.
Bruce Almighty	24	32	A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands.
Bruce Almighty	25	32	Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void.

Bruce Almighty	27	32	God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being revived ‚Äî near miraculously ‚Äî by the doctors.
Bruce Almighty	28	32	Grace arrives and the two rekindle their relationship, later becoming engaged.
Bruce Almighty	29	32	After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories.

To Catch a Thief	3	41	The staff are his old gang from his French Resistance days, paroled based on patriotic war work as long as they keep clean.

To Catch a Thief	21	41	The police chief publicly announces that Foussard was the jewel thief, but, as Robie points out privately in the presence of the abashed Hughson, this would have been impossible because Foussard had a wooden leg, and could not climb on rooftops.

To Catch a Thief	23	41	Outside the graveyard, Frances apologizes to Robie and confesses her love.

To Catch a Thief	28	41	Upstairs, the cat burglar silently cleans out several jewel boxes.
To Catch a Thief	29	41	When Jessie asks the Moor to go get her "heart pills", Robie's voice tips off his identity to the authorities.
To Catch a Thief	30	41	Upon his return, the police wait out Frances and the Moor as they dance together all night.
To Catch a Thief	31	41	Finally, Frances and the Moor go to her room, and the mask is removed: it was Hughson, a switch to conceal Robie's exit.
To Catch a Thief	32	41	On the rooftop Robie lurks.
To Catch a Thief	33	41	His patience is finally rewarded when he is joined by another figure in black.
To Catch a Thief	34	41	But just as his pursuit begins, the police throw a spotlight on him and demand he halt.

The American President	0	34	Popular Democratic President Andrew Shepherd is preparing to run for re-election.
The American President	1	34	The President and his staff, led by Chief of Staff and best friendJ.
The American President	2	34	MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill.
The American President	3	34	However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives do not want it, and liberals think it is too weak.
The American President	4	34	If it passes, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed by his staff to be a shoo-in, and Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and the Congressional support to pass it, by the State of the Union.
The American President	5	34	With the President of France about to arrive in the United States to attend a state dinner in his honor, Shepherd‚Äîwidowed when his wife died of cancer three years earlier‚Äîis placed in an awkward predicament when his cousin Judith, with whom he had planned to attend the dinner, gets sick.
The American President	6	34	The President's attention soon focuses on Sydney Ellen Wade, just hired by an environmental lobbying firm to persuade the President to pass legislation committing his Administration to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
The American President	7	34	During their first meeting, Shepherd and Wade are immediately intrigued by each other.
The American President	8	34	At this meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill by the date of the State of the Union, he will deliver the last 10 votes.
The American President	9	34	Whatever his personal feelings toward Wade, he expresses this to his staff, especially the pragmaticJ, as a sound political move.
The American President	10	34	He believes Wade will not be able to get enough votes to meet her side of the deal, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.
The American President	11	34	Later that evening, in a series of phone calls, Shepherd invites Wade to the state dinner.
The American President	12	34	During the State dinner and subsequent occasions, the couple fall in love.
The American President	13	34	When the Republican presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson learns "the President's got a girlfriend," he steps up his attacks on Shepherd and Wade, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and his family values.
The American President	14	34	The President refuses to respond to these attacks, which drives his approval ratings lower and costs him crucial political support, without which his crime bill seems doomed to failure.
The American President	15	34	At the White House Christmas Party, Wade is dejected about her meeting that day with three Congressmen from Michigan about the environmental bill and how it was a dismal failure; in the process, she inadvertently mentions to the President andJ.
The American President	16	34	that the Congressmen in question said the only bill they were more interested in defeating than the President's crime bill was Wade's environmental bill.
The American President	17	34	Shepherd andJ.
The American President	18	34	are conflicted by this information as Wade clearly had no idea of the implications of this casual conversation, much less that they might actually use this information in their favor and against her environmental bill.
The American President	19	34	Eventually, Wade does manage to get enough votes to meet her part of the deal.
The American President	20	34	However, in the meantime, Shepherd's team discovers he is exactly three votes short, with no other apparent options to acquire them except by shelving the environmental bill, thus solidifying the support of the three Congressmen from Michigan‚Äîwhich he agrees to do.
The American President	21	34	This results in disaster for Wade as she is immediately fired from her lobbyist job for failing to achieve her objectives, as well as seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation.
The American President	22	34	She visits the White House to break up with Shepherd and says that she has a job possibility in Hartford, Connecticut.
The American President	23	34	He tells her politics is making choices, his number-one has always been the crime control bill, and that he does not want to lose her over this.
The American President	24	34	She congratulates him on getting the leverage to pass a crime bill that in no way will help fight crime.
The American President	25	34	She concludes, "Mr.
The American President	26	34	President, you have bigger problems than losing me‚Äîyou've just lost my vote".
The American President	27	34	On the morning that he is to deliver his State of the Union Address, and after an argument withJ, Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebuts Rumson's attacks on Wade's past and his own values and character.
The American President	28	34	He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuels ‚Äî far more than the 10% originally envisioned ‚Äî and that he is withdrawing his support for the weak crime bill, promising to write a stronger one in due time.
The American President	29	34	In his speech he even promises gun control, in an attempt at root-and-branch solving of America's problems.
The American President	30	34	His passionate and erudite defense of those things in which he believes, in contrast to his earlier passive behavior, galvanizes the press and his staff.
The American President	31	34	Shepherd declares he is "going over to her house and I'm not leaving until I get her back", but Wade enters the Oval Office before he can leave.
The American President	32	34	The couple are reconciled and the President, accompanied by Wade, leaves to give his State of the Union Address.
The American President	33	34	The film ends with Shepherd entering the House chamber to thunderous applause.

The Sweetest Thing	5	19	After running into Peter again, Christina buys him a drink and they spend time together, Peter explaining that he will be attending a wedding on Saturday and he is at the club with his obnoxious, womanizing brother Roger (Jason Bateman) to celebrate.

The Sweetest Thing	12	19	When Christina and Courtney finally get to Somerset, Christina begins having second thoughts after visiting a store to replace their wet and ruined clothing only to come out in extremely gaudy, indiscreet outfits, but a series of coincidences gives her a change of heart and they go to Peter's brother's wedding.
The Sweetest Thing	13	19	Arriving, they discover that it is Peter, not Roger who is getting married and the pair nearly ruin the ceremonies in their attempts to escape.
The Sweetest Thing	14	19	Peter and his fiance then decide that they do not want to marry each other and they call off the wedding (much to her father's chagrin) while Christina returns home and back to a newly unfulfilled life of being single again.
The Sweetest Thing	15	19	Later, Peter finds Christina's address in the log at the store they bought their clothing in and tracks her down.
The Sweetest Thing	16	19	Christina, determined not to fear the commitment, kisses Peter and then walks away disappointed.
The Sweetest Thing	17	19	Sometime later, Courtney is dating a doctor and is clearly very attracted to him, and Peter is interviewed like the men at the beginning of the film, retelling his version of the events calling her a bitch and a player, but ultimately revealing that he and Christina are together, having gotten married and are living very happily with Jane and Courtney and Roger as well.
The Sweetest Thing	18	19	Whether they all live together is left ambiguous.

The Great Race	0	37	The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) are competing daredevils at the turn of the 20th century.
The Great Race	1	37	Leslie is the classic hero ‚Äì always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful.
The Great Race	2	37	Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain ‚Äì usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, maniacal evil laugh, grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure.
The Great Race	3	37	Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey.
The Great Race	4	37	They design and build a new car named "The Leslie Special".
The Great Race	5	37	Fate builds his own race vehicle, the Hannibal Twin-8, complete with hidden devices of sabotage.
The Great Race	6	37	Others cars enter in the race, including New York City's most prominent newspaper.
The Great Race	7	37	Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood), a vocal suffragette.
The Great Race	8	37	The seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen (Peter Falk) has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race.
The Great Race	9	37	The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy (Keenan Wynn), Maggie DuBois driving a Stanley Steamer by herself, and Fate and Max.
The Great Race	10	37	The newspaper's car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special.
The Great Race	11	37	Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Boracho.

The Great Race	13	37	Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest.
The Great Race	14	37	Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and "wanted to go back to New York".
The Great Race	15	37	The two remaining cars reach the Bering Strait and park side-by-side in a blinding snowstorm.
The Great Race	16	37	Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors.
The Great Race	17	37	Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car.
The Great Race	18	37	They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended Russian port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him.
The Great Race	19	37	Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead.
The Great Race	20	37	After driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Pottsdorf, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Hapnick (also played by Lemmon) is a double for Fate.
The Great Race	21	37	Rebels under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe (Ross Martin) and General Kuhster (George Macready) kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie.
The Great Race	22	37	Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others.
The Great Race	23	37	Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom.
The Great Race	24	37	Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe.
The Great Race	25	37	Following a climactic sword duel with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it.
The Great Race	26	37	Leslie and Max return the real Prince in time for his coronation and depart with Fate and Maggie.
The Great Race	27	37	Fate takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake.
The Great Race	28	37	A pie fight ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators.
The Great Race	29	37	As the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie's car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris.
The Great Race	30	37	Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships.
The Great Race	31	37	Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the Eiffel Tower to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race.
The Great Race	32	37	Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win.
The Great Race	33	37	Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York.
The Great Race	34	37	The return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team.
The Great Race	35	37	Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon.
The Great Race	36	37	In the final scene, the cannon misfires, knocking down the Eiffel Tower.
The Love Bug	0	43	In 1968, Jim Douglas is a down-on-his luck racing driver, reduced to competing in demolition derby races against drivers half his age.
The Love Bug	1	43	Jim lives in an old fire house overlooking San Francisco Bay with his friend and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz, a jolly Brooklynite who constantly extols the virtues of spiritual enlightenment, having spent time amongst Buddhist monks in Tibet, and builds "art" from car parts.
The Love Bug	2	43	After yet another race ends in a crash (and Tennessee turns his Edsel into a sculpture), Jim finds himself without a car and heads into town in search of some cheap wheels.
The Love Bug	3	43	He is enticed into an upmarket European car showroom after setting eyes on an attractive sales assistant and mechanic, Carole Bennett.
The Love Bug	4	43	Jim witnesses the dealership's British owner, Peter Thorndyke, being unnecessarily abusive towards a white Volkswagen Beetle that rolls into the showroom, and defends the car's honor, much to Thorndyke's displeasure.
The Love Bug	5	43	The following morning Jim is shocked to find that the car is parked outside his house and that Thorndyke is pressing charges for grand theft.
The Love Bug	6	43	A heated argument between Jim and Thorndyke is settled when Carole persuades Thorndyke to drop the charges if Jim buys the car on a system of monthly payments.
The Love Bug	7	43	Jim soon finds the car is prone to going completely out of his control and believes Thorndyke has conned him.
The Love Bug	8	43	Tennessee, however, believes certain inanimate objects to have hearts and minds of their own and tries to befriend the car, naming it Herbie.
The Love Bug	9	43	Jim's feelings about his new acquisition soon improve when it appears Herbie is intent on bringing him and Carole together.
The Love Bug	10	43	He also discovers Herbie to have an incredible turn of speed for a car of his size and decides to take him racing.
The Love Bug	11	43	After watching Jim and Herbie win their first race together, Thorndyke, himself a major force on the local racing scene, offers to cancel the remaining payments Jim owes on Herbie if Jim can win a race that they will both be competing in at Riverside later that month.
The Love Bug	12	43	Jim accepts, and despite Thorndyke's underhanded tactics, he and Herbie take victory.
The Love Bug	13	43	Over the next few months they go on to become the toast of the Californian racing circuit, while Thorndyke suffers increasingly humiliating defeats.
The Love Bug	14	43	Thorndyke finally snaps, and persuades Carole to take Jim out on a date while he sneaks round to Jim's house.
The Love Bug	15	43	After getting Tennessee drunk on his own Irish coffee recipe, Thorndyke proceeds to tip the remainder of the alcoholic coffee and whipped cream into Herbie's gas tank.
The Love Bug	16	43	At the following day's race, an apparently hungover Herbie shudders to a halt and backfires while Thorndyke blasts to victory.
The Love Bug	17	43	However, as the crowd admires Thorndyke's victory, Herbie blows some whipped cream out of his exhaust pipe, covering Thorndyke.
The Love Bug	18	43	That evening, Jim returns home in a brand new Lamborghini 400GT, having agreed to sell Herbie to Thorndyke to pay the remaining installments he owes on it.
The Love Bug	19	43	Jim states he needs a "real car" for the upcoming El Dorado road race, but finds no sympathy from Tennessee, Carole, or Herbie, who jealously proceeds to damage the sleek sports car, proving to Jim once and for all he has a mind of his own.
The Love Bug	20	43	By the time Thorndyke arrives to collect Herbie, he is nowhere to be found, and Jim sets off into the night hoping to find Herbie and make amends before the car is seized by Thorndyke's goons.
The Love Bug	21	43	After narrowly escaping being torn apart in Thorndyke's workshop, and a destructive spree through Chinatown, during the Chinese New Year's parade, Herbie is about to launch himself off the Golden Gate Bridge when Jim reaches him.
The Love Bug	22	43	In his attempt to stop Herbie from driving off the bridge, Jim nearly falls into the water.
The Love Bug	23	43	Herbie pulls Jim back to safety, but then is impounded by the San Francisco Police Department.
The Love Bug	24	43	There, Tang Wu, (Benson Fong) a Chinese businessman whose store was damaged during Herbie's rampage, demands compensation that Jim can no longer afford.
The Love Bug	25	43	Using the Chinese he learned while in Tibet, Tennessee tries to reason with Wu, and learns that he is a huge racing fan who knows all about Jim and Herbie's exploits.
The Love Bug	26	43	Wu is willing to drop the charges in exchange for becoming Herbie's new owner.
The Love Bug	27	43	Jim agrees to this, as long as Wu allows him to race the car in the El Dorado.
The Love Bug	28	43	If Jim wins, Wu will be able to keep the prize money, but has to sell Herbie back for a dollar.
The Love Bug	29	43	Wu replies to this proposal in clear English: "Now you speak my language.
The Love Bug	30	43	"  The El Dorado runs through the Sierra Nevada mountains from Yosemite Valley to Virginia City and back.
The Love Bug	31	43	Before the start of the race, Thorndyke persuades Wu to make a wager with him on its outcome.
The Love Bug	32	43	Thorndyke (with his assistant Havershaw acting as co-driver) pulls every trick in the book to ensure he and his Thorndyke Special are leading at end of the first leg of the race.
The Love Bug	33	43	As a result of Thorndyke's shenanigans, Jim (with Carole and Tennessee as co-drivers) limps home last with Herbie missing two wheels and having to use a wagon wheel to get to the finish line.
The Love Bug	34	43	Despite Tennessee's best efforts, it looks as if Herbie will be unable to start the return leg of the race the following morning.
The Love Bug	35	43	Thorndyke then arrives and claims that this makes him the new owner of the car.
The Love Bug	36	43	Wu regretfully tells Jim of the wager and that in accordance with its terms this is true.
The Love Bug	37	43	Thorndyke, thinking he is Herbie's new owner, gloats to Jim about what he's going to do to Herbie and kicks Herbie's front fender, and punches Jim, but Herbie then unexpectedly lurches into life and chases Thorndyke from the scene, showing he is more than willing to race on.
The Love Bug	38	43	Thanks to some ingenious shortcuts, Jim is able to make up for lost time in the second leg and is neck and neck with Thorndyke as they approach the finish line.
The Love Bug	39	43	In the ensuing dogfight, Herbie's hastily welded-together body splits in two.
The Love Bug	40	43	The back half (carrying Tennessee and the engine) crosses the line just ahead of Thorndyke, while the front (carrying Jim and Carole) rolls over the line just behind, meaning Herbie takes both first and third place.
The Love Bug	41	43	In accordance with the terms of the wager, Wu takes over Thorndyke's car dealership (hiring Tennessee as his assistant), while Thorndyke and Havershaw are relegated to lowly mechanics.
The Love Bug	42	43	Meanwhile, a fully repaired Herbie chauffeurs the newlywed Jim and Carole away on their honeymoon.

Gigli	0	23	Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a low-ranking Los Angeles mob enforcer who isn't nearly as tough as he likes to act.
Gigli	1	23	Louis (Lenny Venito), a higher-ranking member of Gigli's organization, commands Gigli to kidnap the mentally challenged younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor to use as a bargaining chip to save New York City-based mob boss Starkman (Al Pacino) from prison.
Gigli	2	23	Gigli successfully convinces the young man, Brian Dorf (Justin Bartha), to go off with him by promising to take him "to the Baywatch", apparently a reference to the television show of that name, which seems to be Brian's singular obsession.
Gigli	3	23	Louis, however, does not trust Gigli to do the job properly, so he hires a woman calling herself Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) to take charge.
Gigli	4	23	Despite being attracted to Ricki, Gigli resents both Louis' lack of faith in him and having to take orders from a woman.
Gigli	5	23	He is also frustrated by Brian's insistence on going to "the Baywatch" and by Ricki's lesbianism.
Gigli	6	23	A suspicious detective (Christopher Walken) comes to the apartment to question Gigli in reference to Brian's disappearance.
Gigli	7	23	Gigli is further annoyed when his mother (Lainie Kazan) takes an immediate liking to Ricki and when the two women team up to needle him.
Gigli	8	23	The events take a darker turn when Gigli and Ricki receive orders to cut off Brian's thumb, something that neither wants to do.
Gigli	9	23	Worse, Ricki's ex-girlfriend, Robin (Missy Crider), shows up at Gigli's apartment, accusing Ricki of changing sexual orientation.
Gigli	10	23	Robin slits her wrists and has to be rushed to the hospital.
Gigli	11	23	While at the hospital, Gigli goes to the morgue and cuts off a corpse's thumb, which he sends to the prosecutor as Brian's thumb.
Gigli	12	23	Gigli and Ricki go back to Gigli's apartment, where Gigli confesses his love and the two sleep together.
Gigli	13	23	The next morning, they are summoned to meet with the mob's boss.
Gigli	14	23	Starkman reveals that he did not approve of the plan to kidnap a federal prosecutor's brother or the order to cut off Brian's thumb.
Gigli	15	23	He nevertheless rages at them because the thumb they sent didn't match Brian's fingerprint and therefore not only failed to increase pressure on the prosecutor but even undermined the organization's credibility.
Gigli	16	23	Starkman then kills Louis, presumably in retaliation for the kidnapping and associated scrutiny by law enforcement.
Gigli	17	23	Starkman is about to kill Ricki and Gigli as well, but Ricki talks him out of it by pointing out that only they know where Brian is and only they can silence Brian and prevent him from revealing the involvement of Starkman's organization in the kidnapping or even accusing Starkman of having been personally involved.
Gigli	18	23	They leave Starkman's home, decide to leave the mob, and discuss taking Brian back to where they found him.
Gigli	19	23	On the way, they discover Baywatch (or a similarly themed show or film) shooting an episode on the beach.
Gigli	20	23	Brian begs to be let off there and finally they consent.
Gigli	21	23	Gigli convinces Ricki to take his car, but at the last minute, Ricki returns and picks up Gigli, and they leave town together.
Gigli	22	23	All of the characters are transformed by the episode: Louis' mob is disrupted, Gigli has dropped his hyper-masculine fa√ßade, Ricki has a heterosexual fling with Gigli, and Brian gradually emerges from his shell, noticing other people and conversing.
Two Arabian Knights	0	33	During the First World War, two American soldiers become trapped in no man's land.

Two Arabian Knights	2	33	While they are brawling, the Germans sneak up and capture them.
Two Arabian Knights	3	33	In a German prison camp, the two become friends when Phelps takes responsibility for an unflattering caricature he drew of a guard, rather than let O'Gaffney take the blame.
Two Arabian Knights	4	33	The two escape, stealing the white robes of Arab prisoners to blend in with the snow.
Two Arabian Knights	5	33	However, they encounter (and are forced to join) a group of similarly garbed Arab prisoners being sent by train to Constantinople.
Two Arabian Knights	6	33	Near the end of their journey, Phelps creates a distraction, and the two men jump off, landing in a hay wagon.
Two Arabian Knights	7	33	When the hay is loaded onto a ship bound for Arabia, so are they.
Two Arabian Knights	8	33	The stowaways are discovered, but the skipper (Michael Visaroff) is satisfied when Phelps pays him their fare.
Two Arabian Knights	9	33	When a small boat founders nearby, Phelps jumps in to try to rescue an Arabian woman, Mirza (Mary Astor).
Two Arabian Knights	10	33	Both he and the woman have to be saved by O'Gaffney.
Two Arabian Knights	11	33	The two soldiers and the skipper vie for the veiled woman's affections.
Two Arabian Knights	12	33	Phelps eventually coaxes her into removing her veil, and is entranced by her beauty.
Two Arabian Knights	13	33	Meanwhile, the woman's escort observes this development with disapproval.
Two Arabian Knights	14	33	The skipper insists on being paid for Mirza's fare, but none of the three have any money left.
Two Arabian Knights	15	33	They hold him off as best they can.
Two Arabian Knights	16	33	When they reach their destination, the skipper refuses to let Mirza debark without paying, so O'Gaffney robs the purser (Boris Karloff) to get the money.
Two Arabian Knights	17	33	Mirza is met by Shevket Ben Ali (Ian Keith); Mirza informs Phelps that her father has arranged for her to marry Shevket.
Two Arabian Knights	18	33	They depart.
Two Arabian Knights	19	33	The Americans jump overboard when the skipper discovers what happened to his purser.
Two Arabian Knights	20	33	The two men head for the American consul, but leave hastily without speaking to him when they find the skipper already there lodging a complaint.
Two Arabian Knights	21	33	They decide to seek the assistance of Mirza's father the Emir, who turns out to be the governor of the region.
Two Arabian Knights	22	33	However, Mirza's escort has told him and Shevket that Phelps has seen her without her veil.
Two Arabian Knights	23	33	Outraged, the Emir sends his men to bring the Americans back to be executed.
Two Arabian Knights	24	33	Unaware of this, the two soldiers saunter into the Emir's palace.
Two Arabian Knights	25	33	Fortunately, Phelps reads Mirza's warning note in time, and the two escape.
Two Arabian Knights	26	33	When Phelps sets out to rescue Mirza, O'Gaffney shows true friendship and accompanies him.
Two Arabian Knights	27	33	They are trapped by Shevket and his men, but when Mirza threatens to kill herself, Shevket proposes they settle this with a duel in which only one of the pistols is loaded.
Two Arabian Knights	28	33	Phelps agrees and fires first; his gun is the unloaded one.
Two Arabian Knights	29	33	Mirza is made to leave the room.
Two Arabian Knights	30	33	Then Shevket reveals that both guns are empty; he did not wish to wager his life with a "dog".
Two Arabian Knights	31	33	He exits, leaving his men to dispose of Phelps.
Two Arabian Knights	32	33	The two men overcome their captors, relieve Shevket of Mirza, and ride away.

Blue Crush	22	24	Keala finishes her turn, then paddles out and takes Anne Marie under her wing and encourages her to take the best wave of the day, on which Anne Marie manages to score perfectly.
Blue Crush	23	24	Although she does not advance to the next heat, she has regained her lost confidence, but also attracted the notice of sponsors, one of which includes an offer to join the Billabong women's surf team.

No Exit	1	24	They had all expected torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead find a plain room furnished in the style of the Second French Empire.
No Exit	2	24	At first, none of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Joseph says that he was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made; In√®s, however, is the only one to demand that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their moral crimes.
No Exit	3	24	She refuses to believe that they have all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable; she deduces that they are to be one another's torturers.

No Exit	5	24	In√®s tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her "mirror" by telling her everything she sees, but ends up frightening her instead.
No Exit	6	24	It is soon clear that In√®s is attracted to Estelle, Estelle is attracted to Joseph, and Joseph is not attracted to either of the two women.
No Exit	7	24	After arguing, they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other.

No Exit	9	24	Despite their revelations, they continue to get on each other's nerves.
No Exit	10	24	Joseph finally begins giving in to the lascivious Estelle's escalating attempts to seduce him, which drives In√®s crazy.
No Exit	11	24	Joseph is constantly interrupted by his own guilt, however, and begs Estelle to tell him he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime.
No Exit	12	24	While she complies, In√®s tells him that Estelle is just feigning attraction to him so that she can be with a man ‚Äì any man.
No Exit	13	24	This causes Joseph to abruptly attempt an escape.
No Exit	14	24	After his trying to open the door repeatedly, it inexplicably and suddenly opens, but he is unable to bring himself to leave, and the others remain as well.
No Exit	15	24	He says that he will not be saved until he can convince In√®s to trust in him.
No Exit	16	24	She refuses, saying that he is obviously a coward, and promising to make him miserable forever.
No Exit	17	24	Joseph concludes that rather than torture devices or physical punishment, "hell is other people".
No Exit	18	24	Estelle tries to persevere in her seduction of Joseph, but he says that he cannot make love while In√®s is watching.
No Exit	19	24	Estelle, infuriated, picks up a paper knife and repeatedly stabs In√®s.
No Exit	20	24	As they are all already dead, this attack does nothing and In√®s even halfheartedly stabs herself, beginning to laugh.
No Exit	21	24	As Estelle comments on the idea of their being trapped here forever and laughs too, all three join in a prolonged fit of laughter before Joseph finally concludes, "Eh bien, continuons" (roughly "Eh well, let's continue.

Return to Mayberry	0	38	Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith), now living in Cleveland as a US Postal Inspector, returns to his native Mayberry to see his son Opie (Ron Howard) become a first-time father, and also to run in the soon-to-be held sheriff's election, as he has already asked county clerk Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) to prepare the paperwork.
Return to Mayberry	1	38	But when Andy learns that his old deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts), now back in Mayberry working as acting sheriff, announced his own candidacy while Andy was on the road back to town he quietly tells Opie, "I won't run against Barney".
Return to Mayberry	2	38	Andy goes to visit Barney at the sheriff's office.
Return to Mayberry	3	38	Barney tells Andy that he decided to run for sheriff because nobody else would, and then his opponent Ben Woods decided to run shortly afterward.
Return to Mayberry	4	38	Andy then mentions that Barney's old girlfriend Thelma Lou, newly divorced after less than two years, is back in Mayberry staying with her sister; Barney nonchalantly says he'll eventually go and see her.
Return to Mayberry	5	38	As Barney leaves to teach a safety class at school, they're accosted by Ernest Bass standing on the base of the town flagpole, and who gives them a cryptic rhyme: "Your hair was brown but now it's gray; make that monster go away".
Return to Mayberry	6	38	The "monster" is revealed to be an elaborate publicity stunt orchestrated by young businessman Wally Butler (Richard Lineback), who bought an oriental restaurant outside of town and added a hotel.
Return to Mayberry	7	38	Butler found some old dragon artifacts, presumably left by the restaurant's former owners, and hired Ernest to perpetuate a hoax at Myer's Lake to attract customers by stealing some neighbors' chickens and dogs to make people think they were eaten by the monster.
Return to Mayberry	8	38	Andy goes to the cemetery to visit Aunt Bee's grave, and finds Thelma Lou there visiting her uncle's gravesite.
Return to Mayberry	9	38	Thelma Lou laments about Barney's not calling, but she follows Andy to the school where Barney, in clown makeup, is playacting for a classroom of students.
Return to Mayberry	10	38	Though embarrassed by his appearance, Barney accepts an invitation to dine with Thelma Lou at her sister's house.
Return to Mayberry	11	38	Andy ducks out while the two are reacquainting and drives over to the house where Opie and his wife Eunice live just as she is about to go into labor.
Return to Mayberry	12	38	In a panic, Opie accidentally crashes his car into a tree, and Andy volunteers his car to take them to the hospital.
Return to Mayberry	13	38	On the way, Andy's engine begins to falter, and they only make it as far as Gomer and Goober's garage before Eunice gives birth to a boy.
Return to Mayberry	14	38	Shortly afterward, Barney pulls up, already irritated by the fact that no one told him about the birth, which happened all too fast, but his anger is exacerbated when Gomer (Jim Nabors) and Goober (George Lindsey) mistakenly refer to Andy as "sheriff".
Return to Mayberry	15	38	Later that night, he visits Andy to apologize for how he acted, saying he also felt "left out" of being part of seeing Opie become a father.
Return to Mayberry	16	38	The next day, Gomer and Goober are out fishing at Myer's Lake when Gomer sees a monster sticking its head up out of the water.
Return to Mayberry	17	38	Andy and Barney arrive shortly afterward, but Barney doesn't believe Gomer's story until he sees what looks like monster tracks in the mud (made by Ernest wearing specially made galoshes).
Return to Mayberry	18	38	When Gomer later shows Barney a picture he took of Goober with something unidentifiable in the background, Barney becomes convinced there's a monster in the lake.
Return to Mayberry	19	38	Wally Butler later invites Barney to his new inn, secretly gives him a contribution check for his campaign, and invites him in to talk to a TV news reporter about his discovery.
Return to Mayberry	20	38	Andy's wife Helen follows Andy back to Mayberry and only then finds out that Andy has opted out of the sheriff's race, and Opie receives a highly lucrative job offer from a newspaper in Binghamton, New York.
Return to Mayberry	21	38	With Barney's opponent Woods now running an aggressive campaign to discredit Barney, Howard and Opie try to convince Andy to re-enter the race, saying that Barney doesn't stand a chance.

Return to Mayberry	23	38	Otis quickly races to the courthouse to tell Barney.
Return to Mayberry	24	38	Despite Andy's pleading with Barney to drop the hunt because people were laughing at him, Otis' report convinces Barney to resume the hunt.
Return to Mayberry	25	38	Later, when Andy and Barney take Helen and Thelma Lou out to dinner at Butler's Inn, Andy notices some old pictures of the restaurant when it was still oriental.
Return to Mayberry	26	38	Noticing a particular picture with a dragon's head in it (and remembering Ernest's rhyme), Andy is inspired to do some investigating of his own: He drives up to the hills and visits the Darlings' homestead, where Ernest hangs out.
Return to Mayberry	27	38	Briscoe Darling (Denver Pyle) and his daughter Charlene (Maggie Peterson) are delighted to see Andy, but Ernest nervously and repeatedly asks Andy to leave.
Return to Mayberry	28	38	After sitting in with the Darlings to play a song, Andy manipulates Ernest into telling him when the monster will show up in Myer's Lake again.
Return to Mayberry	29	38	The next day, Helen and Thelma Lou are having lunch at Butler's Inn.
Return to Mayberry	30	38	When Helen mentions Andy and Barney are both up at Myer's Lake intent on trapping the "monster", Butler excuses himself and hurriedly drives off to the lake.
Return to Mayberry	31	38	At the lake, Barney clumsily baits a trap (involving a frozen chicken tied to the end of a rope) while Andy spots Ernest going into a nearby stone quarry shed.
Return to Mayberry	32	38	Butler arrives at the shed to futilely get Ernest to reel the monster back in, but Andy catches both of them in the act.
Return to Mayberry	33	38	Barney and Howard follow Andy to the shed, and Andy makes it look like Barney plotted to make Butler overconfident and force his hand.
Return to Mayberry	34	38	Howard takes pictures of Barney with the dragon's head for the newspaper, and Andy tells Butler about the legal consequences of his actions, but suggests that Ernest return the stolen chickens and dogs, and then implores Butler to try honesty with his next business venture, saying "It works better".
Return to Mayberry	35	38	Later, at a victory rally for Sheriff Fife, when Barney learns that Andy opted out of the sheriff's race to give Barney a better chance to win, he humbly asks the crowd to vote for Andy as a write-in candidate because "That's exactly what I'm gonna do".
Return to Mayberry	36	38	Andy is eventually elected the "new" sheriff, Opie accepts the newspaper job in Binghamton, and Barney and Thelma Lou finally get married, with Ernest and the Darlings joining in the celebration.
Return to Mayberry	37	38	The final shot (seen behind the end credits) is of Sheriff Taylor and Deputy Fife folding up an American flag at the end of the day on Mayberry's Main Street.

Sweet Charity	18	64	There is general agreement amongst the dancers that she needs to be "laid down".

Sweet Charity	20	64	", and Charity recovers enough to prompt Vittorio with "your apartment.
Sweet Charity	21	64	".
Sweet Charity	22	64	Lying down on Vittorio's bed, Charity claims she is no longer hungry.
Sweet Charity	23	64	She admits she is a dance hall hostess, putting it down to "the fickle finger of fate" (a favorite expression of hers).

Sweet Charity	25	64	Starstruck, Charity asks for a signed photograph to prove to the girls she was really in his apartment.

Funny Face	13	38	Once she arrives, they start treating her like a doll, trying to make her over, pulling at her clothes and attempting to cut her hair.

Funny Face	22	38	Through some scheming, Maggie and Dick make it into the soiree at Flostre's home.
Funny Face	23	38	After performing an impromptu song and dance for Flostre's disciples, they confront Jo and Flostre.

50 First Dates	0	41	Henry Roth is a veterinarian at Sea Life Park on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
50 First Dates	1	41	He has a reputation of womanizing female tourists and does not display any interest in committing to a serious relationship.
50 First Dates	2	41	Henry's closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; his assistant Alexa, whose gender is unclear; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus.
50 First Dates	3	41	One day Henry‚Äôs boat breaks down while he is sailing around Oahu.
50 First Dates	4	41	He goes to the Hukilau Caf√© to wait for the Coast Guard.
50 First Dates	5	41	There he sees a young woman named Lucy Whitmore, who makes architectural art with her waffles.
50 First Dates	6	41	Henry thinks she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, but the next day he comes back.
50 First Dates	7	41	Lucy and he hit it off instantly and she asks him to meet her again tomorrow morning.
50 First Dates	8	41	When Henry goes back to the caf√©, Lucy does not have any recollection of ever meeting him.
50 First Dates	9	41	The restaurant owner Sue (Amy Hill) explains to Henry that one year ago, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday.
50 First Dates	10	41	On the way back, they had a serious car accident that left Lucy with anterograde amnesia and she wakes up every morning thinking it is October 13, 2002.
50 First Dates	11	41	To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out October 13's Sunday newspaper, rewatching the same Minnesota Vikings game, and refilling Lucy's shampoo bottles.
50 First Dates	12	41	Despite Sue's warning, Henry invites Lucy to have breakfast with him.
50 First Dates	13	41	Eventually she does, but it ends poorly when Henry unintentionally hurts Lucy‚Äôs feelings.
50 First Dates	14	41	He follows her home to apologize where Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone.
50 First Dates	15	41	Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy on the following days, such as pretending to have car trouble, creating a fake road block, or by having Ula beat him up.
50 First Dates	16	41	Eventually, Marlin and Doug figure this out due to Lucy singing The Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice" on the days when she meets Henry.
50 First Dates	17	41	One day, as Henry is about to sit with Lucy at breakfast, she notices a police officer writing her a ticket for her expired plates.
50 First Dates	18	41	Lucy attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, and takes a newspaper to prove herself, but sees that the date on all the newspapers is not October as she thought.
50 First Dates	19	41	When she rushes home, Marlin and Doug are forced to admit their ruse (and presumably not for the first time; when Marlin sees Lucy's frantic behavior as her truck pulls up to the house, he immediately realizes what happened and loudly announces to Doug that Lucy "had a bad day").
50 First Dates	20	41	Henry comes up with an idea to make a video explaining to Lucy her accident and their relationship.
50 First Dates	21	41	Although Lucy is upset over understanding about her accident and memory loss, Henry believes that she is more upset realizing her life is a lie every day.
50 First Dates	22	41	Because of this, Henry, Marlin and Doug show Lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off.
50 First Dates	23	41	She spends more time with Henry and goes to see some of her old friends.
50 First Dates	24	41	Lucy decides to erase Henry completely from her life after learning of his decision not to take a sailing trip to Bristol Bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years.
50 First Dates	25	41	Although Henry would rather spend that year making Lucy fall in love with him everyday rather than go on the sailing trip, Lucy is convinced she is a burden on him and is preventing Henry from really living his life.
50 First Dates	26	41	Henry reluctantly helps Lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship.
50 First Dates	27	41	A few weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his sailing trip.
50 First Dates	28	41	Before he departs, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the brain institute and teaching an art class.
50 First Dates	29	41	He also tells him that she sings.
50 First Dates	30	41	Then he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD.
50 First Dates	31	41	Listening to the CD, Henry becomes emotional and curses Marlin for giving him the CD and causing him to miss Lucy.
50 First Dates	32	41	He then remembers that Marlin once told him that Lucy only sings after she meets him.
50 First Dates	33	41	Concluding that Lucy remembers him, he returns home.
50 First Dates	34	41	Henry rushes to the brain institute where Lucy now resides and asks if she knows who he is.
50 First Dates	35	41	Lucy says she does not know him but shows him the pictures she has painted of him, saying she dreams about him every night.
50 First Dates	36	41	Some time later, Lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked "Good Morning Lucy".
50 First Dates	37	41	It again informs her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry‚Äôs wedding.
50 First Dates	38	41	On the tape, Henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready.
50 First Dates	39	41	Lucy then sees that she is on Henry‚Äôs boat, which finally made it to Alaska.
50 First Dates	40	41	She goes up on deck and meets Marlin, Henry and their daughter, Nicole.

Real Genius	4	37	Professor Jerry Hathaway meets high school student Mitch Taylor at the school's science fair.
Real Genius	5	37	He informs Mitch that he has been admitted to Pacific Technical University, where he will room with physics "legend" Chris Knight.

Real Genius	7	37	Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is an irreverent slacker who spends his time pulling elaborate high tech pranks.
Real Genius	8	37	Mitch also meets Jordan, a hyperkinetic female student, "Ick" Ikagami, a brilliant and affable foil to Chris's antics, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld, a middle-aged man who seems to be living in Mitch's closet.
Real Genius	9	37	Hathaway's sycophantic graduate assistant Kent becomes hostile when Hathaway puts Mitch in charge of the laser project.
Real Genius	10	37	Under pressure to get results, Hathaway gives Chris an unrealistic timetable, which Chris dismisses.

Real Genius	14	37	Chris convinces him to stay by explaining to him that Lazlo was the top genius at Pacific Tech in the 1970s, but suffered a breakdown when he learned that his theories were being used to build weapons.
Real Genius	15	37	Chris tells Mitch that if he does not want to "crack" like Hollyfeld, he must learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent, calling it a "moral imperative" to do so.

Real Genius	17	37	Kent vows revenge.

Real Genius	23	37	In a fit of anger at the laser's destruction, he has an epiphany that solves the power problem.
Real Genius	24	37	The beam of the redesigned laser has unlimited range and produces an estimated six megawatts of power, exceeding the original requirement.
Real Genius	25	37	While the team celebrates its success, Lazlo insists that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceived for this purpose.
Real Genius	26	37	Chris is devastated.
Real Genius	27	37	Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab.
Real Genius	28	37	Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him.
Real Genius	29	37	The group tails Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base.
Real Genius	30	37	While Chris and Mitch talk their way onto the base, Lazlo remotely cracks the laser's computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway's house, where the team has placed a huge tin of popcorn.
Real Genius	31	37	Meanwhile, Chris and Mitch remove circuits that prevent the laser from overheating.
Real Genius	32	37	When the laser beam hits the house, it is diffused by a prism placed by Chris and the popcorn heats and expands; the house bursts at the seams as popcorn pours out onto the lawn.
Real Genius	33	37	Kent "rides" the flowing popcorn out of the front door unharmed and laughing, thinking the incident was religious in nature.
Real Genius	34	37	The group, reveling in their success, greet an arriving Lazlo accompanied by Sherry, riding in a motor home pulling a trailer full of prizes he won in a sweepstakes.
Real Genius	35	37	He and Sherry indicate they intend to run off together as he is the genius she's been looking for all this time.

Maskerade	8	14	Another employee is suspected, but turns out to be a member of the Cable Street Particulars.
Maskerade	9	14	The witches determine that the finances of the Opera House, which are a complete mess, have been made so intentionally in order to hide the fact that money is being stolen, with the murders being used either as a distraction or to cover evidence.
Maskerade	10	14	It is finally revealed that two people had been masquerading as the ghost.
Maskerade	11	14	The original (and harmless) ghost, Walter Plinge, was being psychologically manipulated by the second ghost, Mr Salzella (Director of Music at the Opera House), who assumed the identity to commit the murders and theft.

Mr. Deeds	0	22	Multibillionaire Preston Blake freezes to death while on a mountain climbing expedition.
Mr. Deeds	1	22	With no widow or legitimate children, it is initially unclear who would earn the right to Blake's massive fortune.
Mr. Deeds	2	22	It is found that Blake has a living grandnephew named Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), who runs a pizzeria in New Hampshire and also writes greeting cards in the hopes that Hallmark may be interested in one.
Mr. Deeds	3	22	Deeds is contacted and flown to New York City by businessman Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher), who is temporarily in control of Blake Media.
Mr. Deeds	4	22	Deeds' unorthodox helicopter trip includes a stop at a Wendy's for a Frosty as well as a singing of David Bowie's Space Oddity.
Mr. Deeds	5	22	Once Deeds arrives in New York, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days while all the legal details are worked out.
Mr. Deeds	6	22	The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), who works for a tabloid show called Inside Access, has a co-worker pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated that Deeds wanted to meet a girl by "rescuing" her, the same way his father had met his mother.
Mr. Deeds	7	22	Deeds does so, and beats up her "robber", and Babe goes out with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson, a school nurse from a made-up town called Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa (which later turns out to be a real town, which Babe is flabbergasted to find out).
Mr. Deeds	8	22	Though Babe initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the unfailingly kind-hearted Deeds, and decides to tell him that she is not who she says she is, but Inside Access, in concert with Cedar (who was fed the truth by the fake robber and was smitten with Babe) reveals it to Deeds first.

Mr. Deeds	10	22	After returning to Mandrake Falls, he learns from Crazy Eyes (Steve Buscemi) that Cedar intends to sell off the company, which will cause thousands of people to lose their jobs (Cedar had convinced Longfellow to sell his shares by lying that he will work commanding the company in honor of Preston's lifetime of work).
Mr. Deeds	11	22	Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back, but after saving her life when she falls through the ice over a lake, he rejects her, saying he does not really know who she is.
Mr. Deeds	12	22	At a shareholders meeting, Cedar has everyone convinced to sell the company, until Deeds (who has bought a single share) arrives and manages to convince everyone not to sell.
Mr. Deeds	13	22	But Cedar claims control of a majority of the shares and the sale is approved.
Mr. Deeds	14	22	Bennett arrives and reveals that Emilio Lopez, Preston Blake's longtime butler is his illegitimate son and the true heir as a result of a younger Preston having an amorous affair with his maid in 1958 (at one point he had told Deeds that Blake treated him "like a son").
Mr. Deeds	15	22	Realizing Emilio is his cousin, Deeds convinces him they must stop Cedar and that he is the rightful CEO.
Mr. Deeds	16	22	As a result of Emilio supplanting Longfellow as the heir, Deeds' sale of shares are retracted and Cedar is fired.
Mr. Deeds	17	22	Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media.
Mr. Deeds	18	22	Babe then reconciles with and kisses Deeds after professing her love for him.
Mr. Deeds	19	22	As they leave the meeting, Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and offers him a billion dollars, some of which Deeds spends on red Corvettes for everyone in Mandrake Falls.
Mr. Deeds	20	22	When he returns to the pizzeria with Babe, he learns that Hallmark is interested in buying one of his greeting cards: the one he wrote for Babe when he professed his love for her.
Mr. Deeds	21	22	They both share a kiss as the movie ends with Crazy Eyes crashing his Corvette and coming out unharmed.

13 Going on 30	0	30	On May 26, 1987, Jenna Rink, a gawky girl, yearns to be popular, but the only way she can get the ruling clique - the "Six Chicks," led by the arrogant Lucy "Tom-Tom" Wyman - to attend her upcoming 13th birthday party is by doing their homework.
13 Going on 30	1	30	Jenna's best friend, the geeky boy Matty Flamhaff, (with the horrible nickname of Beaver because he looks like the star of "Leave It To Beaver") arrives early to the party to give her a bright pink, dream dollhouse that he built for her.
13 Going on 30	2	30	He sprinkles his second gift, a packet of glittery "magic wishing dust".
13 Going on 30	3	30	on its roof.
13 Going on 30	4	30	The Six Chicks soon show up with the cutest boys in class and make Jenna play "Seven Minutes in Heaven" While Jenna waits, blindfolded, in a dark closet, thinking a popular boy she has a crush on is about to enter, the Six Chicks vanish with all the boys, half the food and Jenna's completed homework.
13 Going on 30	5	30	It's Matt who walks into the closet, to Jenna's horror.
13 Going on 30	6	30	She locks herself in the closet and cries, wishing to be 30; above her, the glittering wishing dust from the dollhouse gently rains down.
13 Going on 30	7	30	The next morning, Jenna awakens in a gleaming Fifth Avenue apartment.
13 Going on 30	8	30	Jenna's dream has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna, at first utterly baffled, particularly by the handsome hunk in her shower, realises she's magically turned thirty overnight, with no idea of what happened in the intervening seventeen years.
13 Going on 30	9	30	Jenna discovers that she works for Poise, her favourite fashion magazine.
13 Going on 30	10	30	Tough-as-nails Lucy is her co-editor and best friend, but the magazine itself is in serious trouble, having been scooped by a rival magazine named Sparkle so often that the editor-in-chief believes someone inside Poise is tipping them off.
13 Going on 30	11	30	Jenna, freaking out like the frightened teen she still is, wants only to find Matty.
13 Going on 30	12	30	She gets his address and races down to the Village where the now-grown Matt (Mark Ruffalo) is a struggling photographer.
13 Going on 30	13	30	To her confusion, he's distant and cold, and can't even fill Jenna on much of her missing past, because she became head of the "Six Chicks," and never spoke to Matt again.
13 Going on 30	14	30	She even became Prom Queen - and Lucy, her only friend, is actually the original "Tom-Tom' after plastic surgery.
13 Going on 30	15	30	While delighting in her freedom and great clothes, Jenna stumbles through a grown-up world, learning enough of life to advise other 13-year-olds whom she actually prefers to hang with.
13 Going on 30	16	30	But her slowly-emerging past reveals she was nothing like the sweet, shy girl she'd been the day before: this grown-up Jenna stole ideas, refused to speak to her parents, has office sex with the husband of a co-worker.
13 Going on 30	17	30	After Jenna overhears her supposed best friend Lucy badmouthing her, in a plan to save the magazine behind her back, she resolves to fix the sins of the past she can't remember.

13 Going on 30	19	30	Her parents find her there, and they hug.
13 Going on 30	20	30	She gets back in touch with Matt, gingerly apologises and hires him to do the photography on her own new plans for Poise, which is a huge break for him.
13 Going on 30	21	30	Even though Matt has a fianc√©e in Chicago who's eager for him to move there, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other.
13 Going on 30	22	30	Everyone loves Matt's photos and Jenna's new plans to save the magazine, but when Sparkle shows up yet again with this exact material, including Matt's own photographs, and with Lucy as their new head, Poise folds.
13 Going on 30	23	30	Outraged, Jenna confronts Lucy for stealing, but Lucy scornfully tells her that Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine all along; Lucy merely found out about it and did the same thing.
13 Going on 30	24	30	Matt, wounded by what he thought was Jenna's betrayal of him, is getting married the next day.
13 Going on 30	25	30	Jenna rushes out to the leafy suburb on his wedding day, hoping to convince Matt that she wasn't the person she'd seemed to be, that he'd marry her if he could see who she really was, but Matt, already in his tux, says the past can't come back and hands Jenna her pink homemade dollhouse, which he'd kept all these years.
13 Going on 30	26	30	While the wedding begins in the background, Jenna leaves in tears, closing her eyes and clinging to the dollhouse -- on which a few bits of wishing dust still remain.
13 Going on 30	27	30	When Jenna opens her eyes, she's back in 1987, on that same 13th birthday night.
13 Going on 30	28	30	This time, when Matt finds her huddled alone in the closet, she kisses him.
13 Going on 30	29	30	They run upstairs together, bumping into Tom-Tom on the way, Jenna rips up the homework in Tom-Tom's hands and Jenna and Matt run out of the house, emerging as a wedding couple on the other side of the door, and, as credits roll, they're moving into a bright pink house just like the dollhouse that started it all.

Bull Durham	1	23	Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of "Meat", and they get off to a rocky start.
Bull Durham	2	23	Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a "baseball groupie" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the "Church of Baseball" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student.

The Terminal	2	32	Due to his inability to communicate in proper English, the airport's branch of the US Customs and Border Protection seize both his passport and airline ticket, whereupon its temporary director, Frank Dixon, makes him stay in the terminal he came through.

The Terminal	6	32	During his initial days at the terminal, Viktor encounters and helps out a flight attendant named Amelia Warren after she slips on a wet floor and breaks the heel of her shoes, who assumes he is a contractor of sorts from the pager he was given by Customs but is surprised by his respectful kindness to her.
The Terminal	7	32	When Viktor is unable to secure himself some food after Dixon cuts him off from an avenue of money, his plight is noticed by a food service worker at the airport, Enrique Cruz, who offers him food in exchange for helping in learning more about an immigration officer that he is infatuated with, Dolores Torres.
The Terminal	8	32	After meeting with Amelia once again and wanting to take her out for a meal, Viktor begins improving his English while attempting to find work, and is soon hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.
The Terminal	9	32	During this time, he also befriends some of Enrique's friends whom he plays poker with, including a cargo handler named Joe Mulroy, and an Indian janitor named Gupta Rajan, learning from the latter that he had come to the States in order to avoid being arrested for stabbing a corrupt police officer back in India in 1979.
The Terminal	10	32	When a Russian traveler creates a delicate situation when Customs try to remove the medicine he is carrying for his father, Dixon is annoyed when Viktor, whom he uses to persuade the man to leave the medicine behind, claims he misheard his Krakozhian dialect for "father" as "goat" so the traveler can leave with them.

The Terminal	14	32	After helping Enrique finally marry Torres, Viktor awaits the arrival of Amelia.
The Terminal	15	32	Unbeknown to him, Dixon pulls her aside to question her about Viktor, revealing his true situation in the process.
The Terminal	16	32	Feeling that he lied to her, Amelia confronts Viktor in Gate 67, shocked at his predicament, and tries to learn why he came to New York.
The Terminal	17	32	Agreeing to tell her, Viktor reveals the contents of the peanut can he was carrying, explaining that his late father, a jazz enthusiast, had discovered the famous portrait, "A Great Day in Harlem", in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, where after spending a week looking at it, he vowed he would collect the signatures of all 57 of the jazz musicians featured on it.
The Terminal	18	32	Viktor reveals that the can contains not only a copy of the portrait, but the autographs of all the musicians his father received, but one - tenor saxophonist Benny Golson.

The Terminal	20	32	After hearing his story, Amelia kisses Viktor.
The Terminal	21	32	After having spent nine months in the terminal, Viktor is awakened by his friends who give him news that the war in Krakozhia has ended.
The Terminal	22	32	Overjoyed, he celebrates in an airport bar, where Amelia meets with him and explains that a man she had been having an affair with, a government official, helped her to secure Viktor with a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream.
The Terminal	23	32	While delighted, Viktor is saddened when he learns that her "friend" did so in order to renew their relationship.
The Terminal	24	32	Despite this, Viktor heads off to Customs with renewed hope of going to New York, only to find that Dixon must sign the visa.
The Terminal	25	32	Seizing the opportunity, Dixon instructs Viktor to go home to Krakozhia, threatening to cause trouble for Viktor's friends by deporting them if he refuses.
The Terminal	26	32	Unwilling to let that happen, he agrees to do so, despite his friends offering to prevent this happening.
The Terminal	27	32	When Gupta, assuming he was acting a coward, learns of the situation he was put into, he decides to take the burden off Viktor by running in front of the plane to Krakozhia as it taxies to the terminal, choosing to let himself be deported back to his home country in order to let his friend go to New York.
The Terminal	28	32	Dixon, shocked by this, attempts to stop Viktor leaving as he receives gifts from employees for his trip into the city, but is thwarted by his Custom agents, who allow him to leave.
The Terminal	29	32	As Viktor leaves, seeing Amelia once more before taking a taxi, Dixon decides to finally not pursue him further.

Meet the Parents	3	36	Greg hopes to propose to Pam in front of her family after receiving her father's permission, but this plan is put on hold when the airline loses his luggage, including the engagement ring.
Meet the Parents	4	36	When they arrive at the Byrnes' home, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro), her mother Dina (Blythe Danner) and their beloved cat, Jinx (also named mr Jinx or Jinxy), a brown and black Himalayan cat.
Meet the Parents	5	36	Jack takes an instant dislike to Greg and openly criticizes him for his chosen career of nursing and whatever else he sees as a sign of weakness.
Meet the Parents	6	36	Greg's attempts to impress Jack either go unnoticed or backfire: He inadvertently leads Jack to think he does drugs, while mentioning the possible subtle drug references in "Puff, the Magic Dragon" while listening to the song on the car stereo on the way to the drug store, and Jack later finds a marijuana pipe that he believes belongs to Greg (it actually belongs to Pam's younger brother, Denny).
Meet the Parents	7	36	At dinner, Greg, who is Jewish, recites the lyrics from the song "Day by Day" from the musical "Godspell" when asked to say Grace, and makes up a story about milking a cat in an attempt to explain to Jack why he had earlier caught Greg reading a pharmacy magazine about lactation.
Meet the Parents	8	36	Greg presents the Byrnes family with a bottle of Mumm's champagne he bought from the drug store, but as soon as Jack reveals that Pam had a previous fianc√©, the cork suddenly pops off by itself and accidentally smashes an urn which holds the remains of Jack's mother, giving Jinx the opportunity to urinate in the ashes.
Meet the Parents	9	36	Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after receiving an impromptu lie detector test from Jack, and Pam later reveals that Jack is actually a recently retired CIA counterintelligence officer.
Meet the Parents	10	36	Meeting the rest of Pam's family and friends, including Debbie, her fiance, his parents, and Pam's highly successful, both financially and spiritually, ex-fiancee Kevin (Owen Wilson), Greg still feels like an outsider.
Meet the Parents	11	36	Things between Greg and Jack go from bad to worse during a game of water volleyball, where Jack becomes irritated with Greg's incompetent playing, and in an attempt to play more seriously, Greg accidentally hits Debbie while spiking the ball, giving her a bloody nose and a black eye; and when Greg later uses a malfunctioning toilet (and claims that Jinx used it, which Jack does not accept), the Byrnes' yard is flooded with sewage.
Meet the Parents	12	36	The airline arrives with the luggage that Greg lost, but it turns out to not be his, and while Greg is on the phone attempting to solve the issue, he accidentally causes Jinx to get loose.

Meet the Parents	17	36	Later, the Byrnes family realizes Jinx is missing and Greg, in a last-ditch effort to win Jack over, goes to an animal shelter, finds a feral cat who looks almost exactly like Jinx, except for a white tip on the tail (whereas Jinx has an all-black tail), puts Jinx's collar on him and spray-paints his tail to make the cat look just like Jinx.
Meet the Parents	18	36	While the entire family is out to dinner, Jack gets a voicemail that the real Jinx is at their neighbor's house.
Meet the Parents	19	36	Greg overhears this, and desperately tries to beat Jack home to erase the evidence, but ultimately fails after Jack takes a shortcut.
Meet the Parents	20	36	The family returns home to find the stray cat has completely trashed the living room.
Meet the Parents	21	36	Jack angrily calls Greg out in front of the entire family for his lack of honesty, and demands that he call off his relationship with Pam and leave immediately.
Meet the Parents	22	36	By now, the entire Byrnes family, including Pam, agree with Jack that Greg needs to leave.
Meet the Parents	23	36	Desperate to save himself, Greg reveals that he has witnessed Jack speaking with strange characters (including speaking with someone in Thai over the phone and meeting with a man in a drug store parking lot) and is planning a secret mission to Thailand after Pam's sister's wedding, thus lying about being retired from the CIA.
Meet the Parents	24	36	However, Greg realizes that the hole he dug himself into just got much deeper as Jack angrily explains that the "mission" he was planning was actually a surprise honeymoon to Ko Samui for the newlywed couple and that the man he was meeting with in the parking lot was a travel agent giving him their visas.
Meet the Parents	25	36	As a result, Greg breaks up with Pam, and Greg starts to leave.
Meet the Parents	26	36	Just as Greg is leaving, an airport employee arrives with Greg's real missing luggage, under the name "Gaylord Focker" much to the amusement of the Byrneses.
Meet the Parents	27	36	Greg goes to the airport but, devastated by his break-up with Pam and still upset about the luggage mix-up, gets so angry that he eventually finds himself detained by airport security for causing a scene on the plane while frustratingly trying to get his luggage into the overhead storage hold and for saying the word "bomb".
Meet the Parents	28	36	Back at the Byrnes' household, Jack still believes that Greg would be an unsuitable husband, as he is completely dishonest and incompetent.
Meet the Parents	29	36	Upon receiving retribution from his wife, who claims that Jack never warmed up to Kevin until after he and Pam broke up, and Pam (as well as confirmation that Greg actually aced the MCAT's), Jack realizes that Pam truly loves Greg.
Meet the Parents	30	36	Jack rushes to the airport, convinces airport security to release Greg, and demands that he be honest about everything that transpired.
Meet the Parents	31	36	Greg admits that he loves Pam, and everything he did before was out of desperation to win Jack's approval.
Meet the Parents	32	36	Jack admits that maybe he had been too hard on Greg, and he brings him back to the Byrnes' household.
Meet the Parents	33	36	Greg proposes to Pam.
Meet the Parents	34	36	She accepts, and her parents agree that they should now meet Greg's parents.
Meet the Parents	35	36	After Debbie's wedding, Jack views footage of Greg recorded by hidden cameras that he had placed strategically around their house.

Empire Records	6	46	In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling $9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling.

Empire Records	8	46	Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table.
Empire Records	9	46	Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening managerJ.
Empire Records	10	46	(Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry).
Empire Records	11	46	He confides in the pair about the previous night's events before riding away, seemingly for good.

Empire Records	13	46	Joe is distracted from immediately dealing with this crisis due to a scheduled store event: Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield), a former 80's pop idol, is due to arrive at the store for an autograph session to promote his new album.
Empire Records	14	46	The staff is unenthused by "Rex Manning Day", and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men.

Empire Records	16	46	Lucas returns after the store opens and Joe confronts him about the missing deposit.

Empire Records	25	46	This leads to the revelation that Corey is secretly using Amphetamines.
Empire Records	26	46	After arguing with Corey, Gina has sex with Rex Manning, causing the rift between the two friends to intensify and Rex to get kicked out of the store by Joe.
Empire Records	27	46	Deb takes Corey aside and advises her on the questionable choices she is making, choices which may have dire consequences on her bright future.
Empire Records	28	46	In return, Corey holds a mock funeral for Deb and the whole store attends.

Empire Records	30	46	The pugnacious "Warren Beatty" keeps his word and returns to the store with a gun (loaded with blanks) to seek revenge.
Empire Records	31	46	Lucas reveals that he was once a troubled youth much like "Warren" until he was taken in by Joe, who gave him a home and a job and helped him turn his life around.
Empire Records	32	46	The staff surmises that "Warren" just needs a similar chance.
Empire Records	33	46	Joe subsequently offers him a job at the store.
Empire Records	34	46	After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests calling Mitchell.
Empire Records	35	46	However, the employees, Joe, and Jane ‚Äî who has since quit working for Rex ‚Äî pool their resources to replace the missing money.
Empire Records	36	46	Despite their best efforts, they are thousands short.
Empire Records	37	46	Suddenly inspired, Mark runs out of the store, jumps in front of a news crew covering the holdup, and announces a late night benefit party to "Save the Empire".
Empire Records	38	46	The store opens its doors and collects donations while selling food, drinks, and merchandise to raise the remaining money.
Empire Records	39	46	They manage to raise just enough, which they offer to store owner Mitchell.
Empire Records	40	46	Mitchell in turn offers to sell the store to Joe, admitting that Joe has always loved the place while he himself has always hated it.
Empire Records	41	46	Joe agrees to become the new owner.
Empire Records	42	46	Corey meets up with a dejectedJ on the roof and confesses that she does love him.

An Ideal Husband	0	44	The play opens during a dinner party at the home of Sir Robert Chiltern in London's fashionable Grosvenor Square.
An Ideal Husband	1	44	Sir Robert, a prestigious member of the House of Commons, and his wife, Lady Chiltern, are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring, a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns, Mabel Chiltern, and other genteel guests.
An Ideal Husband	2	44	During the party, mrs Cheveley, an enemy of Lady Chiltern's from their school days, attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina.
An Ideal Husband	3	44	Apparently, mrs Cheveley's dead mentor and lover, Baron Arnheim, convinced the young Sir Robert to sell him a Cabinet secret, a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase.
An Ideal Husband	4	44	Sir Robert made his fortune with that illicit money, and mrs Cheveley has the letter to prove his crime.
An Ideal Husband	5	44	Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage, Sir Robert submits to her demands.
An Ideal Husband	6	44	When mrs Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert's change of heart regarding the canal scheme, the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern, unaware of both her husband's past and the blackmail plot, insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise.
An Ideal Husband	7	44	For Lady Chiltern, their marriage is predicated on her having an "ideal husband"‚Äîthat is, a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship: thus Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions.
An Ideal Husband	8	44	Sir Robert complies with the lady's wishes and apparently seals his doom.
An Ideal Husband	9	44	Also toward the end of Act&nbsp;I, Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago.
An Ideal Husband	10	44	Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it.
An Ideal Husband	11	44	In the second act, which also takes place at Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight mrs Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife.
An Ideal Husband	12	44	He also reveals that he and mrs Cheveley were formerly engaged.
An Ideal Husband	13	44	After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert, Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel.
An Ideal Husband	14	44	He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving.
An Ideal Husband	15	44	Once Goring leaves, mrs Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening.
An Ideal Husband	16	44	Incensed at Sir Robert's reneging on his promise, she ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room.
An Ideal Husband	17	44	Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him.
An Ideal Husband	18	44	In the third act, set in Lord Goring's home, Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help, a letter that might be read as a compromising love note.
An Ideal Husband	19	44	Just as Goring receives this note, however, his father, Lord Caversham, drops in and demands to know when his son will marry.
An Ideal Husband	20	44	A visit from Sir Robert, who seeks further counsel from Goring, follows.
An Ideal Husband	21	44	Meanwhile, mrs Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and, misrecognised by the butler as the woman Goring awaits, is ushered into Lord Goring's drawing room.
An Ideal Husband	22	44	While she waits, she finds Lady Chiltern's letter.
An Ideal Husband	23	44	Ultimately, Sir Robert discovers mrs Cheveley in the drawing room and, convinced of an affair between these two former lovers, angrily storms out of the house.
An Ideal Husband	24	44	When she and Lord Goring confront each other, mrs Cheveley makes a proposal.
An Ideal Husband	25	44	Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship, she offers to exchange Sir Robert's letter for her old beau's hand in marriage.
An Ideal Husband	26	44	Lord Goring declines, accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns' marriage.
An Ideal Husband	27	44	He then springs his trap.
An Ideal Husband	28	44	Removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer, he binds it to Cheveley's wrist with a hidden lock.
An Ideal Husband	29	44	Goring then reveals how the item came into her possession.
An Ideal Husband	30	44	Apparently mrs Cheveley stole it from his cousin, Mary Berkshire, years ago.
An Ideal Husband	31	44	To avoid arrest, Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff.
An Ideal Husband	32	44	After Goring obtains and burns the letter, however, mrs Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern's note from his desk.
An Ideal Husband	33	44	Vengefully she plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord.
An Ideal Husband	34	44	mrs Cheveley exits the house in triumph.
An Ideal Husband	35	44	The final act, which returns to Grosvenor Square, resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending.
An Ideal Husband	36	44	Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel.
An Ideal Husband	37	44	Lord Caversham informs his son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House.
An Ideal Husband	38	44	Lady Chiltern then appears, and Lord Goring informs her that Sir Robert's letter has been destroyed but that mrs Cheveley has stolen her letter and plans to use it to destroy her marriage.
An Ideal Husband	39	44	At that moment, Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern's letter, but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee, he assumes it is meant for him, and reads it as a letter of forgiveness.
An Ideal Husband	40	44	The two reconcile.
An Ideal Husband	41	44	Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Sir Robert's decision to renounce his career in politics, but Lord Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign.
An Ideal Husband	42	44	When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister's hand in marriage, still believing he has taken up with mrs Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night's events and the true nature of the letter.
An Ideal Husband	43	44	Sir Robert relents, and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed.

Mr. Destiny	0	38	The story begins on "the strangest day" of Larry Burrows' (James Belushi) life (his 35th birthday) consisting of a series of comic and dramatic misadventures.
Mr. Destiny	1	38	Larry, who blames all of his life's problems on the fact that he struck out during a key moment of his state high school baseball championship game on his 15th birthday, wishes he had done things differently.
Mr. Destiny	2	38	His wish is granted by a guardian angel-like figure named Mike (Michael Caine), and appears at various times as a bartender, a cab driver, and so on.
Mr. Destiny	3	38	Larry soon discovers that Mike has transferred Larry into an alternative reality in which he had won the pivotal high school game.
Mr. Destiny	4	38	He now finds himself rich and (within his company) powerful, and married to the boss's (Bill McCutcheon) sexy daughter Cindy Jo Bumpers (Rene Russo).
Mr. Destiny	5	38	At first, his new life seems perfect, but he soon begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzler (Jon Lovitz) and wife Ellen (Linda Hamilton) from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternative self has created many enemies, like Jewel Jagger (Courteney Cox), and as Larry's problems multiply, he finds himself wishing to be put back into his old life.
Mr. Destiny	6	38	The story begins with Larry's car, an old Ford LTD station wagon, stalled out in a dark alley.
Mr. Destiny	7	38	Suddenly the pink lights of "The Universal Joint," a bar, come on.
Mr. Destiny	8	38	Larry goes inside to call a tow truck, and tells bartender Mike his troubles.
Mr. Destiny	9	38	He reviews the day he just had, which ended with his getting fired after discovering his department head Niles Pender's (Hart Bochner) scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners to a group of naive Japanese investors.
Mr. Destiny	10	38	He tells Mike that he wishes he'd hit that last pitch out of the park, after which Mike fixes him a drink called "The Spilt Milk".
Mr. Destiny	11	38	The Spilt Milk was a drink that gave him his wish that he hit that home run in that championship game.
Mr. Destiny	12	38	Larry leaves the bar, walks home (his car apparently towed) and discovers someone else living in his house, which is now fixed up (previously his yard and driveway were muddy and unfinished).
Mr. Destiny	13	38	Mike appears as a cab driver and drives him to his "new" home, a mansion in Forest Hills, explaining that he did in fact hit the last pitch and won the game.
Mr. Destiny	14	38	He soon discovers that Cindy Jo is his wife and he's the president of his company, Liberty Republic Sporting Goods.
Mr. Destiny	15	38	Being a classic car buff, he's shocked to find that he owns a collection of priceless antique automobiles.
Mr. Destiny	16	38	Larry soon discovers that Clip has a low-level job in the accounting department and is quite insecure, as opposed to the jokester he was before.
Mr. Destiny	17	38	Ellen is shop steward (in both realities) and is married to another man.
Mr. Destiny	18	38	Jewel, a forklift operator in the previous reality, is now Larry's mistress and his secretary.
Mr. Destiny	19	38	Ellen hates Larry and he discovers that the union is threatening a walkout due to massive layoffs and increased production, since Niles is selling Liberty Republic in both realities.
Mr. Destiny	20	38	Seeing Ellen, he realizes how much he misses her and agrees to all the union's demands, providing Ellen agrees to dinner at his favorite restaurant.
Mr. Destiny	21	38	She reluctantly agrees, and Larry eventually convinces her that they were married in a previous life.
Mr. Destiny	22	38	After discovering that Larry has agreed to union demands, Niles takes revenge, by telling both Cindy Jo and Jewel of Larry's dinner date with Ellen.
Mr. Destiny	23	38	He then plots to kill Larry at the office that night.
Mr. Destiny	24	38	However, company owner Leo Hansen arrives to deliver a note to Larry, announcing his termination, and Niles kills him by mistake.
Mr. Destiny	25	38	Discovering the note, Niles calls the police who attempt to arrest Larry for Leo's murder.
Mr. Destiny	26	38	Larry escapes while jealous Jewel creates pandemonium outside in her attempts to shoot him (and shoots out a number of police cars in the process), leading to a police chase.
Mr. Destiny	27	38	Larry is eventually cornered in a dark alley but the pink glow of "The Universal Joint" comes on and he runs into the bar.
Mr. Destiny	28	38	Unable to find Mike, Larry attempts to make the "Spilt Milk" himself, the ingredients clearly aged.
Mr. Destiny	29	38	The flashing lights of the police cars appear and Larry surrenders but instead of cops, a tow truck driver named Duncan enters (the police car lights now tow truck lights).
Mr. Destiny	30	38	Confused at first, Larry sees Mike back behind the bar and realizes he's back in his old life.
Mr. Destiny	31	38	Larry thanks Mike for everything and, upon exiting the bar, suddenly realizes that the deal with the Japanese investors is happening shortly.
Mr. Destiny	32	38	Driven by Duncan to company headquarters, Larry barges into the boardroom, decks Niles and exposes his scheme just as Leo is about to sign the deal.
Mr. Destiny	33	38	Thinking everyone forgot his birthday, Larry returns home (which still has the muddy driveway and lawn) to a surprise party with his family and friends in attendance.
Mr. Destiny	34	38	Soon after, Cindy Jo and her husband Jackie Earle (Jay Sanders), the company president arrive.
Mr. Destiny	35	38	Jackie offers Niles' job to Larry, plus a company car, a new Mercedes and he accepts.
Mr. Destiny	36	38	Back in the past, young Larry is about to leave the stadium, still upset about the loss, when he's approached by a mysterious stranger (Mike) who reassures him that everything will be alright.
Mr. Destiny	37	38	Larry thanks him for the reassurance, but walks off wondering who Mike thinks he's kidding.

Down with Love	0	35	In early 1960s New York City, Barbara Novak arrives in town at Banner House to present her new work, Down with Love, a book the intent of which is to free women from love, teach them to enjoy sex without commitment, and to replace the need for a man with things such as chocolate.
Down with Love	1	35	Following her rules would, she believes, help to give women a boost in the workplace and in the world in general.
Down with Love	2	35	The men who run Banner House refuse to support the book.
Down with Love	3	35	The only way Vikki Hiller, Barbara's editor, can find to promote the book is for Barbara to meet Catcher Block ‚Äì a successful writer for the magazine Know and a notorious "ladies' man, man's man, man about town" ‚Äì but he avoids her repeatedly by postponing their dates until she gets fed up, insults him, and walks out.
Down with Love	4	35	Catcher's boss and best friend, Peter MacMannus, and Vikki take a liking to one another.
Down with Love	5	35	However, their relationship revolves around Barbara and Catcher, and neither is brave enough to express their feelings for the other.
Down with Love	6	35	Peter feels overshadowed by Catcher's strong personality, and Vikki wants to see emotional commitment in her lover.
Down with Love	7	35	She even assumes Peter must be gay due to his perceived lack of interest.
Down with Love	8	35	Barbara starts promoting her book with Vikki's help, and things take off when they get Judy Garland to sing the song "Down with Love" as a promotion to the book on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Down with Love	9	35	Sales skyrocket, as housewives and women around the world buy the book and rebel against their men; Catcher now wants to meet Barbara, but now it is she who rejects him.
Down with Love	10	35	It all comes to a boiling point when Barbara appears on a national TV show talking about a chapter from the book ‚Äì "The Worst Kind of Man" ‚Äì and cites Catcher Block as the perfect example.
Down with Love	11	35	Subsequently, Catcher's date rejects him, which infuriates him.
Down with Love	12	35	Catcher swears revenge on Barbara and to undo the damage (as he sees it) done by her book by writing the "expos√© of the Century" - he will prove to the world that, deep down, all women are the same, they all want love and marriage.
Down with Love	13	35	Including Barbara Novak.
Down with Love	14	35	He arranges for a casual meeting at a dry cleaner shop, taking advantage of the fact that Barbara has never met or seen him, and he poses as an astronaut, Major Zip Martin, attentive and polite.

Down with Love	17	35	But he starts falling for her, and it gets harder to go through with his plan.
Down with Love	18	35	When Barbara finds Catcher/Zip at a party he is almost caught out, and decides it is time to take everything to the next level: he tells Barbara that Catcher Block wants to interview him for an expos√© on the NASA space program and asks her to accompany him.
Down with Love	19	35	It is his own apartment, and he sets everything up to record her saying she loves him.
Down with Love	20	35	But then it is she who reveals the truth: she knew he was really Catcher from the beginning, but she also lied as she is not Barbara Novak but Nancy Brown, once one of Catcher's many secretaries, who fell in love with him while working at Know, but who turned him down when he asked her out because she did not want to be just another one in his long list of romances.
Down with Love	21	35	She tells him she did this to be different from all the women he knew, and make him love her.
Down with Love	22	35	They both realize that Catcher does love her, but as he is proposing, one of his many lovers appears and thanks Barbara for what she has done for womankind.
Down with Love	23	35	Barbara realizes that she does not want love or him as she has become a real "down with love" girl.
Down with Love	24	35	Vikki and Peter's relationship also changes when she insults him for helping Catcher.
Down with Love	25	35	Peter realizes he is indeed like any other man and takes Vikki to Catcher's apartment to take things to the next level.
Down with Love	26	35	Days later, Catcher is completely depressed; all his efforts to win Barbara back have failed.
Down with Love	27	35	Even his expos√© is ruined now that Barbara has told her story in her own magazine, Now.
Down with Love	28	35	Peter is also depressed as his relationship with Vikki is now apparently based only on sex.
Down with Love	29	35	Catcher realizes he can do something and writes a new expos√© "How Falling In Love With Barbara Novak Made Me A New Man".
Down with Love	30	35	He learns there is an opening at Now and goes for an interview with her.
Down with Love	31	35	There, he tells her how much she changed him, and it is obvious she wants him but turns him down anyway; he says he wished there could be a middle ground for them "somewhere between a blonde and a brunette", referring to her real persona, where she was a brunette.
Down with Love	32	35	As he is leaving her office, he realizes she is not coming after him, but she surprises him on the elevator, showing him a bright red hair style: she has found the middle ground and she wants to be with him.
Down with Love	33	35	They fly to Vegas to get married, influencing Vikki and Peter, who also decide to get married.
Down with Love	34	35	Their marriage results in a new book intended to end the battle of the sexes, with the pair ultimately singing "Here's To Love".

Sideways	0	30	Miles Raymond is an aspiring&nbsp;‚Äì but unsuccessful&nbsp;‚Äì writer, a wine aficionado and a divorced, depressed, borderline alcoholic middle-aged English teacher living in San Diego, who takes his soon-to-be-married actor friend and former college roommate, Jack Cole, on a road trip through Santa Ynez Valley wine country.
Sideways	1	30	Though still recognized on occasion, Jack's acting career appears to have peaked years ago, when he had a role in a popular TV soap but now does commercial voice-overs and plans to enter his future father-in-law's successful real estate business after he's married.
Sideways	2	30	Miles wants to spend the week relaxing, golfing, enjoying good food and wine; however, much to Miles' consternation, Jack is on the prowl and wants one last sexual fling before settling into domestic life.
Sideways	3	30	In the wine country, the pair visit Miles' favorite restaurant, The Hitching Post II, and meet Maya, an attractive, intelligent waitress with whom Miles is casually acquainted.
Sideways	4	30	Jack senses that Maya is interested in Miles, who downplays his friend's intuition, and tells Jack that Maya is married.
Sideways	5	30	Jack tells Maya that Miles' manuscript has been accepted for publication, even though it is only being considered.
Sideways	6	30	Later, at a tasting in a local winery, they meet an attractive wine pourer named Stephanie, who is also acquainted with Maya.
Sideways	7	30	Jack is immediately attracted to Stephanie and arranges a double date, to include Miles and Maya, and tells Miles that he learned Maya is no longer married ("sans rock", as he describes it).
Sideways	8	30	During the date, Miles gets drunk and telephones Vicki, his ex-wife, after learning from Jack earlier that day that she has remarried.
Sideways	9	30	They return to Stephanie's home, where Jack and Stephanie immediately adjourn to her bedroom for sex, while Miles and Maya connect through their mutual interest in wine.
Sideways	10	30	Miles tells Maya about his book, and Maya says she is finishing a master's degree in horticulture so she can leave serving.

Sideways	12	30	They leave separately, but not before he gives her a copy of his manuscript.
Sideways	13	30	As the week progresses, Jack's affair with Stephanie continues, to the point where he believes he's falling in love with her; he bonds with her daughter and makes the suggestion to Miles that they move there for him to be closer to Stephanie.

Sideways	15	30	The next day, Miles lets it slip that Jack is to be married.

Sideways	17	30	On finding out his manuscript has been rejected again, Miles drinks heavily, and when the server cuts him off, he ends up drinking from the spit bucket, but Jack eases him out of the room in time.
Sideways	18	30	That night, with Stephanie gone, Jack hooks up with another waitress named Cammi, who recognized him from his acting career.
Sideways	19	30	Hours later, Jack shows up back at the motel room he shares with Miles&nbsp;‚Äì naked and confessing that Cammi's husband came home early while she and Jack were having sex.
Sideways	20	30	Jack explains he was forced to flee without his clothes and wallet (which contains a pair of irreplaceable wedding rings).
Sideways	21	30	Jack convinces Miles to drive him back to Cammi's house and sneak inside, where he discovers Cammi and her husband having sex.
Sideways	22	30	Miles spies Jack's wallet, grabs it and runs from the house, barely escaping Cammi's irate husband, who pursues him in the nude.

Sideways	25	30	Following the wedding ceremony, Miles runs into his ex-wife Vicki and meets her new husband.
Sideways	26	30	After learning that she is also pregnant, Miles accepts that he will never get Vicki back.

Raise Your Voice	28	30	Terri's teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might.

Million Dollar Baby	8	33	Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory.

Million Dollar Baby	29	33	Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, Mo Chuisle (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): Irish for "my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse").
Million Dollar Baby	30	33	He never returns to the gym.
Million Dollar Baby	31	33	Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character.

100 Girls	4	44	After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps.

100 Girls	6	44	When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman.
100 Girls	7	44	He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as "Jane-ites", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen.
100 Girls	8	44	He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women.
100 Girls	9	44	Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the "bra matching the panties", and Matthew accuses him of being too macho.
100 Girls	10	44	Rod introduces Matthew to the "penile power", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size.
100 Girls	11	44	He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias.
100 Girls	12	44	Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight.
100 Girls	13	44	Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness.

100 Girls	23	44	ms Stern asserts that women, rather than men, should be in command.
100 Girls	24	44	Rod tells Matthew that he's a chicken and should just give up on girls, while Matthew tells him that he has never been able to speak to girls, especially Cynthia (Jaime Pressly).
100 Girls	25	44	Matthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper asking the girl he's seeking to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night.
100 Girls	26	44	He sits in the dark every Thursday night, waiting for her to show up.

100 Girls	28	44	Finally, the mystery maiden does show up, only to tell him to stop looking for her.
100 Girls	29	44	Despite the approach of the end of the semester, Matthew isn't deterred.
100 Girls	30	44	He disguises himself in drag, as Francesca, as a means to continue his search.
100 Girls	31	44	In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia one on one which, (until she is injured later on), he is not able to do because he is intimidated by her good looks.
100 Girls	32	44	Rod flirts with Francesca and later brags to Matthew that he had sex with Francesca.
100 Girls	33	44	This makes Matthew so angry that he adds another weight onto Rod's "penile power" device, hurting him.
100 Girls	34	44	Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag while he fights with Patty.
100 Girls	35	44	Matthew bites off part of Crick's tongue.
100 Girls	36	44	As a result, Crick is unable to speak without lisping.
100 Girls	37	44	Desperation sets in, so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory.
100 Girls	38	44	He finally determines his mystery maiden is Patty.
100 Girls	39	44	She initially rejects him because she thought that he would see her only as a slut.
100 Girls	40	44	Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew has him arrested for sexually assaulting him (when he was dressed as Francesca).
100 Girls	41	44	Matthew introduces Rod and Dora, and Arlene and Wendy hook up.

Fun and Fancy Free	34	55	However, it turns out that the beans are truly magical after all as later that night, the light of a full moon causes a beanstalk to sprout from under the house and lift it far up into the sky.

Fun and Fancy Free	37	55	There they stumble across the harp locked in a small box, as she explains that she was kidnapped by a "wicked giant".
Fun and Fancy Free	38	55	Sure enough, just then, a giant named Willie emerges from the shadows, grunting angrily but then suddenly breaking into a happy song ("Fee Fi Fo Fum") and bouncing a ball about while demonstrating rather amazing powers like flight, invisibility, and shapeshifting.

Fun and Fancy Free	48	55	However, Willie wakes up from his sleep and spots them, giving chase all the way to the beanstalk.
Fun and Fancy Free	49	55	Mickey stalls him long enough for Donald and Goofy to reach the bottom and begin sawing the beanstalk.
Fun and Fancy Free	50	55	Mickey arrives just in time to finish the job of cutting down the beanstalk, and Willie, who was climbing down, falls to his apparent death.
Fun and Fancy Free	51	55	Back in the narrator's home, the narrator (be it Ludwig Von Drake or Edgar Bergen) finishes his story and cheers up his companion (be it Herman or Mortimer Snerd), who was crying for Willie.
Fun and Fancy Free	52	55	Just as the narrator says that Willie is a fictional character and not real, Willie himself appears, alive and well, tearing the roof off the narrator's house.

Grosse Pointe Blank	0	28	Professional assassin Martin Blank finds himself depressed and bored with his work.
Grosse Pointe Blank	1	28	A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds as he is unaffiliated.

Grosse Pointe Blank	3	28	Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, dr Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella.
Grosse Pointe Blank	4	28	She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched.

Grosse Pointe Blank	6	28	When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets.
Grosse Pointe Blank	7	28	Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home.
Grosse Pointe Blank	8	28	He is also pursued by two NSA agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer.

Grosse Pointe Blank	10	28	At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler.

Grosse Pointe Blank	17	28	His rationalizations for his work only scare Debi even more; she rejects his attempts at reconciliation and storms out.
Grosse Pointe Blank	18	28	Martin, concluding that it is futile to try to change his life, fires his psychiatrist over the phone, notifies Marcella that he is laying her off (but directs her to a brick of cash hidden in the office, set aside for her severance pay) and finally opens the dossier containing the details of the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe.
Grosse Pointe Blank	19	28	He is startled to find that the target is Debi's father, Bart, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's client.
Grosse Pointe Blank	20	28	Grocer decides to kill Bart himself to impress Martin's client.

She's Gotta Have It	0	16	Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) is a young, attractive, sexually independent Brooklynite who juggles three suitors: the polite and well-meaning Jamie Overstreet (Tommy Redmond Hicks); the self-obsessed model Greer Childs (John Canada Terrell); and the immature, motor-mouthed Mars Blackmon (Spike Lee).
She's Gotta Have It	1	16	Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, but refuses to commit to any of them, cherishing her personal freedom instead, while each man wants her for himself.
She's Gotta Have It	2	16	Her carefree sexually liberated lifestyle ultimately comes to an end when her three male suitors meet and compare notes on Nola.
She's Gotta Have It	3	16	While Greer justifies Nola's callous behavior by claiming that she sees the three not as individuals but as a collective, Jamie and Mars become bitter over how little Nola cares for all three men.
She's Gotta Have It	4	16	Realizing that Mars and Greer are too scared of losing Nola to force her to choose one of the three men, Jamie lays down an ultimatum to her that she must choose a single lover.
She's Gotta Have It	5	16	Nola scoffs at this decision, and visits him several days later at his apartment for casual sex.
She's Gotta Have It	6	16	Jamie rapes Nola, while mockingly asking her if he's as good sexually, as Greer or Mars.
She's Gotta Have It	7	16	Being raped causes Nola to have an epiphany: realizing that promiscuity has turned Jamie against her, she decides to call Jamie's bluff.
She's Gotta Have It	8	16	Nola dumps Greer and Mars and then tells Jamie that she's is ready for a monogamous relationship.
She's Gotta Have It	9	16	However, there is a catch: Nola, believing that her promiscuity is the source of her inability to commit to a single guy, wants the relationship to be celibate for the time being.
She's Gotta Have It	10	16	Though he at first rejects Nola's "no sex" decree, Jamie agrees to it after initially saying no.
She's Gotta Have It	11	16	Nola and Jamie's reunion however, is followed by a coda which dismantles the "happy ending" of the couple coming together.
She's Gotta Have It	12	16	In a monologue delivered to the camera Nola reveals that her vow of celibacy and her decision to be with Jamie exclusively was "a moment of weakness".
She's Gotta Have It	13	16	Nola explains that she soon began to cheat on Jamie and ultimately the relationship collapsed, though she is vague on specifics or whether or not she resumed her casual affairs with Mars or Greer (the latter of which vowed never to have anything else to do with Nola after being dumped).
She's Gotta Have It	14	16	Nola proudly proclaims that monogamy was a form of slavery and that her promiscuous lifestyle is freedom in its purest form.
She's Gotta Have It	15	16	However, the film implies that Nola is still terminally unhappy with her decision to leave Jamie as the film closes with Nola going to bed all alone.
My Sassy Girl	0	47	The film tells the love story of a male engineering college student, Gyeon-woo, and "the Girl" (who is never named in the movie).
My Sassy Girl	1	47	Gyeon-woo just cannot seem to catch a romantic break.

My Sassy Girl	3	47	At the train station on his way to his aunt's, he observes a drunk girl, standing precariously close to the edge of the train platform as the train approaches; he pulls her to safety just in time.
My Sassy Girl	4	47	Inside the train, Gyeon-woo cannot help but stare at the girl who is his "type" but repulsed by her drunkenness.
My Sassy Girl	5	47	Finally, she throws up on a passenger and faints but not before she calls Gyeon-woo "honey".
My Sassy Girl	6	47	The passenger aggressively chides Gyeon-woo and tells him to take care of his "girlfriend".
My Sassy Girl	7	47	Gyeon-woo, completely flustered, carries her all the way to the nearest hotel.
My Sassy Girl	8	47	Thus begins his comically ill-fated relationship with the Girl.
My Sassy Girl	9	47	They meet each other again after Gyeon-woo gets locked up in jail over a misunderstanding, and over soju the Girl cries, admits to breaking up with her boyfriend the day before and gets thoroughly drunk, resulting in a second trip to the same hotel.
My Sassy Girl	10	47	After this second overnight stay at the hotel, she begins to become a more active part of his life.
My Sassy Girl	11	47	She visits Gyeon-woo in school and pulls him out of class, telling the teacher that Gyeon-woo is the father of her soon-to-be-aborted baby.
My Sassy Girl	12	47	The Girl's mood swings wildly from joyful to downright violent, but Gyeon-woo puts up with it and lets her abuse him for her amusement.
My Sassy Girl	13	47	She is an aspiring scriptwriter and throughout the movie gives Gyeon-woo three different screenplays from different genres.
My Sassy Girl	14	47	The first is an action movie‚ÄîThe Demolition Terminator‚Äîwhich switches gender roles, symbolically having the Girl save her helpless lover (Gyeon-woo).
My Sassy Girl	15	47	The second is a wild perversion of a Korean short story‚ÄîSonagi‚Äîin which the Girl, having died, asks that her lover be buried along with her‚Äîeven though he's still alive.
My Sassy Girl	16	47	The last is a wuxia/samurai movie spoof full of genre clich√©s and anachronisms.
My Sassy Girl	17	47	All three feature the same common thread: the Girl is from the future.
My Sassy Girl	18	47	Despite all the horrible things Gyeon-woo endures, he is determined to help cure the girl's pain.
My Sassy Girl	19	47	He decides to surprise her on her birthday and takes her on a nighttime trip to an amusement park which ends up quite differently from how he planned: the pair encounter an AWOL soldier who holds them hostage and rants about his misery after being jilted.
My Sassy Girl	20	47	Gyeon-woo convinces him to release her, and she in turn convinces the soldier to free Gyeon-woo and go on with his life and pursue another love.
My Sassy Girl	21	47	The Girl and Gyeon-woo's relationship takes a turn for the better and he sends her home and meets her father, who is a habitual drinker.
My Sassy Girl	22	47	Her parents do not take to Gyeon-woo and on leaving, he overhears an impassioned argument between the girl and her mother over her relationship with him.
My Sassy Girl	23	47	He does not hear from her for quite some time and his life without her begins.
My Sassy Girl	24	47	One day however, the Girl calls him and tells him to bring her a rose during class to commemorate their 100th-day anniversary.
My Sassy Girl	25	47	He does this, leading to a touching and romantic scene where he arrives in disguise into a packed auditorium and watches her play the melody of George Winston's variations on Pachelbel's Canon in D on a piano onstage.
My Sassy Girl	26	47	The classmates applaud in approval at his romantic gesture.
My Sassy Girl	27	47	As the night unfolds he is confronted at her house by her parents again, with her father demanding the two to break up.
My Sassy Girl	28	47	The Girl does not contact him again and Gyeon-woo naturally thinks they have broken up, until one day when she calls Gyeon-woo to meet her for dinner with a blind date.
My Sassy Girl	29	47	The Girl introduces Gyeon-woo to the date and, while she leaves for the washroom afterwards, Gyeon-woo candidly offers advice on how to ensure her happiness by asking her potential suitor to follow ten rules: preventing her from overdrinking and giving in to her at every circumstance, even if it means enduring the occasional "violence".
My Sassy Girl	30	47	It is at this point that she realizes how well Gyeon-woo understands her.
My Sassy Girl	31	47	She abruptly leaves her date and searches for Gyeon-woo at the subway station.
My Sassy Girl	32	47	Once reunited the two realize they are at a turning point in their relationship, but, for some unspeakable reason, the Girl decides it is time for them to part.
My Sassy Girl	33	47	As a gesture to their happy times the two write letters to each other and bury them in a "time capsule" under a particular tree on a mountain in the countryside.
My Sassy Girl	34	47	They agree to meet again at the tree after two years to read the letters together.
My Sassy Girl	35	47	After burying the "time capsule" they go their separate ways.
My Sassy Girl	36	47	During the two-year span, Gyeon-woo works hard to improve himself, writing My Sassy Girl movie script after he details their love affair on the Internet.
My Sassy Girl	37	47	When the agreed upon date arrives, he travels to the mountain but the Girl does not show up.
My Sassy Girl	38	47	Eventually, he opens the time capsule and reads her letter and learns the root of her angst and behavior: Gyeon-woo reminds her of her previous boyfriend who, rather than breaking up with her, actually died before she met Gyeon-woo.
My Sassy Girl	39	47	All through the time the Girl and Gyeon-woo were seeing each other she had been seeing her dead boyfriend's mother, who wants to introduce her to a nice young man.
My Sassy Girl	40	47	A year after Gyeon-woo visits the tree, the Girl finally arrives.
My Sassy Girl	41	47	Sitting under the tree is an old man.
My Sassy Girl	42	47	During their conversation the old man reveals the secret of the tree, that it is not the same tree; the original tree had been struck and killed by lightning a year before and a similar tree had been planted by a young man so that his special someone would not be sad.
My Sassy Girl	43	47	After the girl reads his letter, she tries to call Gyeon-woo repeatedly, but is unable to contact him.
My Sassy Girl	44	47	At lunch with her deceased boyfriend's mother after a year later, the mother introduces her nephew‚Äîwho turns out to be Gyeon-woo, whom she has been trying to introduce to the Girl for years.
My Sassy Girl	45	47	The mother, who is Gyeon-woo's aunt, tells the Girl to go out with him, hoping that he could make life easier for her.
My Sassy Girl	46	47	She tells Gyeon-woo that the Girl can give advice to him about his impending trip to England, to which he replies, "I don't have to go anymore".

Kissing Jessica Stein	18	28	Her mother says that she worries about Jessica having this attitude towards life, and that sometimes she thinks back to that night and thinks that if Jessica went on, maybe it wouldn't have been the best, but it might have been pretty good&mdash;and who knows, maybe it would have been the best ever.
Kissing Jessica Stein	19	28	She then tells Jessica that she thinks Helen "is a very nice girl".

Kissing Jessica Stein	23	28	Jessica rejects him, explaining that she already has Helen.
Kissing Jessica Stein	24	28	Jessica and Helen move in together, but their relationship, while good in most respects, begins to suffer from a lack of frequent sexual intimacy.

Monster-in-Law	0	28	Charlie Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) is a temp/dog walker/yoga instructor and aspiring fashion designer from Venice Beach, California, who meets doctor Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan).
Monster-in-Law	1	28	She thinks he's gay at first, based on a lie Kevin's former girlfriend Fiona (Monet Mazur) told her.
Monster-in-Law	2	28	But then Kevin asks her out, and Charlie believes that she's finally found the right man.
Monster-in-Law	3	28	Things start to go wrong when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda).
Monster-in-Law	4	28	Viola is a former newscaster, who has recently been replaced by someone younger, and is in the midst of a meltdown.
Monster-in-Law	5	28	Loathing Charlie from the outset, Viola becomes even more distraught when Kevin proposes to Charlie.
Monster-in-Law	6	28	Fearing that she'll lose her son the same way she lost her career, she sets out to ruin Kevin and Charlie's relationship.
Monster-in-Law	7	28	With Ruby (Wanda Sykes), her assistant, she tries everything possible to drive Charlie away.
Monster-in-Law	8	28	Charlie eventually catches on to Viola's plan and fights back.
Monster-in-Law	9	28	On Charlie's wedding day, Viola turns up wearing a white dress instead of the peach-colored dress specially made for her.
Monster-in-Law	10	28	This leads to a violent stand-off between the two, leading with Viola refusing to accept Charlie and states she'll never be good enough for Kevin.
Monster-in-Law	11	28	Suddenly, Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevin's grandmother, Gertrude Fields (Elaine Stritch), appears and they have an indignant argument, while Gertrude takes a liking to Charlie, saying she is stunning, her grandson is a lucky man, that she is an "exotic Latina", and if only her son, Kevin's father, was as lucky to find a woman like Charlie.
Monster-in-Law	12	28	Gertrude's resentment of Viola bears a strong resemblance to Viola's feelings of animosity toward Charlie.
Monster-in-Law	13	28	Gertrude even believes that Kevin's father had died years ago of "terminal disappointment", for which Gerturde holds Viola responsible.
Monster-in-Law	14	28	Viola counters stating Gertrude "smothered him to death", because she thought nobody was ever good enough for him (basically similar to how Viola is).
Monster-in-Law	15	28	Gertrude, satisfied she got her last word in, leaves; showing she still favors Charlie.
Monster-in-Law	16	28	Charlie decides to back down as she witnesses Gertrude and Viola's relationship.

Monster-in-Law	19	28	But before that can happen, Ruby enters and talks with Viola.
Monster-in-Law	20	28	Viola is miffed that Charlie compared her to Gertrude, although Ruby points out that Viola is actually far worse than Gertrude, as she doesn't ever recall Gertrude trying to poison Viola once, referring to earlier at the rehearsal dinner when Viola put crushed nuts (which Charlie is highly allergic to) in the meal's gravy.
Monster-in-Law	21	28	Ruby points out that Viola's efforts against Charlie to make Kevin happy are unwarranted.
Monster-in-Law	22	28	"Whatever made you think he wasn't.
Monster-in-Law	23	28	" is her final point.
Monster-in-Law	24	28	Viola has an epiphany and realizes that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile, which ends the feud.
Monster-in-Law	25	28	Charlie then explains to Viola that she wants her to stay, too, on one condition: if Viola accepts the boundaries Charlie needs, if she is present at any family event, and if she treats her children with love.
Monster-in-Law	26	28	Charlie and Kevin then get married and when Charlie throws her wedding bouquet, Viola catches the flowers.
Monster-in-Law	27	28	As Charlie and Kevin drive away to their honeymoon, the film ends as Viola and Ruby walk out of the celebration.

Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	3	29	Despite his good fortune, Sherman has a major problem: the personality of his vanquished alter ego, Buddy Love, is still ingrained inside him and causes him to act out in the same crass manner Buddy does.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	4	29	After a few particularly unpleasant incidents, from Buddy kicking in, when Sherman sexually insults his own therapist trying to help him with it, then does the same thing to a woman walking a dog, and later during a toast turns around and reveals that his father was fired rather than retired, and then when Sherman intended on proposing to Denise, but then Buddy kicks in and makes it a perverted sex request, causing Denise to become mortified against him.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	5	29	Sherman heads to his lab where he uses Denise's methodology to isolate and remove the gene in Sherman's DNA where Buddy has manifested.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	6	29	Determined to be rid of Buddy permanently, and despite of Jason warning him of potentially catastrophic consequences for his health, Sherman extracts the gene with from inside his body.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	7	29	However, he does not dispose of the genetic material and as a result, Buddy becomes a sentient being when a hair from a Basset Hound who was Sherman's test subject finds its way into it and causes such a reaction.

Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	21	29	The ball is covered with the new formula, which takes Buddy back to an infantile state and eventually to a glowing mass of genetic material.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	22	29	The idea is for Sherman to suck the genetic material back into his body through a straw, thus putting his DNA back together and returning him to normal.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	23	29	However, as Sherman is chasing what is left of Buddy, the glowing mass evaporates and thus Sherman cannot restore his intelligence.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	24	29	Denise and Cletus arrive too late to save him, and seeing what has happened to Sherman, Denise breaks into tears.

Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	26	29	Seeing that the water is glowing, Denise realizes that the genetic material has reconstituted and that if Sherman drinks the water before it dissipates, he will be restored to normal.
Nutty Professor II: The Klumps	27	29	Although reluctant at first, Sherman drinks two handfuls of the water from Denise's hand then Cletus dunks Sherman's head under the water to drink, and thus he is able to get his genetic makeup back in proper order.

Hatari!	0	57	Hatari.
Hatari!	1	57	is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world.
Hatari!	2	57	As "Momella Game Ltd".
Hatari!	3	57	, they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha.
Hatari!	4	57	The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf a/k/a "the Indian" (Bruce Cabot); drivers "Pockets" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy Kr√ºger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there and owns the business.
Hatari!	5	57	Their method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets.
Hatari!	6	57	Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head.
Hatari!	7	57	(For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender) A smaller, faster "herding car," driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the "catching truck".
Hatari!	8	57	Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it.
Hatari!	9	57	The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy.
Hatari!	10	57	The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season.
Hatari!	11	57	In the opening sequence, the team chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital.
Hatari!	12	57	While they are waiting to hear about the Indian's condition, a young Frenchman (Gerard Blain) approaches Sean about taking the Indian's job.
Hatari!	13	57	This offends Kurt, who knocks the Frenchman down.
Hatari!	14	57	Then dr Sanderson (Eduard Franz) says the Indian may die without a transfusion of rare type AB Negative blood.
Hatari!	15	57	However, the Frenchman has that blood type.
Hatari!	16	57	He agrees to donate his blood for the transfusion.
Hatari!	17	57	The group returns to the compound after celebrating the Indian's survival.
Hatari!	18	57	Sean is surprised to find a strange woman sleeping in his bed.
Hatari!	19	57	The next morning, she introduces herself as Anna Maria D'Alessandro ("Just call me Dallas") (Elsa Martinelli), a photojournalist sent by the Basel Zoo to record the capture of the animals they have ordered.
Hatari!	20	57	Sean is annoyed, but under the contract with the zoo they must accommodate her.
Hatari!	21	57	Dallas quickly makes friends with the others, especially Pockets.
Hatari!	22	57	She rides along on the group's catching runs, snapping pictures.
Hatari!	23	57	Dallas is immediately attracted to Sean, and (she thinks) he to her, but he treats her brusquely.
Hatari!	24	57	Pockets explains that a few years earlier, Sean was engaged to a woman who came to the compound, hated Sean's life there, and abruptly left him.
Hatari!	25	57	Ever since, he distrusts women, especially those to whom he is attracted.
Hatari!	26	57	The young Frenchman comes to the compound and, after proving himself a crack shot, is hired to replace the Indian for the rest of the catching season.
Hatari!	27	57	His name is Charles Maurey, but Sean dubs him "Chips".
Hatari!	28	57	His job is to ride with Kurt in the herding car, carrying a rifle in case an animal attacks.
Hatari!	29	57	The Indian returns, and urges Sean to forego catching any rhinos this season.
Hatari!	30	57	A "nice Belgian kid" was killed in an earlier rhino chase, as was Brandy's father; now the Indian was nearly killed.
Hatari!	31	57	He suggests there is a jinx.
Hatari!	32	57	Sean agrees only to postpone rhino to the end of the season.
Hatari!	33	57	Dallas makes some progress with Sean, but friction between them continues, especially after Dallas adopts first one, then two, and finally three orphaned elephant calves.
Hatari!	34	57	This leads to her adoption into the local Warusha tribe as "Mama Tembo" ("Mother of Elephants").
Hatari!	35	57	Chips and Kurt flirt with Brandy, but as things turn out, it is Pockets Brandy falls for.
Hatari!	36	57	This becomes clear to everyone on a day when the herding car flips over, dislocating Kurt's shoulder and cutting Chips up.
Hatari!	37	57	Brandy doesn't react much to their injuries, but when Pockets falls off a fence and wrenches his back, she is nearly hysterical with worry over his "injury".
Hatari!	38	57	Animal chases continue, with the group capturing a zebra, a giraffe, a gazelle, a buffalo, and a wildebeest.
Hatari!	39	57	They also trap a leopard in a baited cage.
Hatari!	40	57	When the herding car is mired during a river crossing, Chips shoots a crocodile that is threatening Kurt, and a strong friendship develops between them.
Hatari!	41	57	Pockets spends several days privately tinkering in the compound workshop.
Hatari!	42	57	He invents a method of flinging a net over a tree full of monkeys, which the zoos want.
Hatari!	43	57	His rocket-net is a success, catching over 500 of them.
Hatari!	44	57	With all other orders filled, the group catches a rhino without serious incident, and the Indian agrees that the jinx is broken.
Hatari!	45	57	The group goes to Arusha to celebrate the end of the season, but Dallas declines.
Hatari!	46	57	She is frustrated, because though she has had some intimate moments with Sean, he has never clearly declared how he feels about her.
Hatari!	47	57	When Sean urges her to join the group's excursion, she lashes out at him and bursts into tears, leaving him baffled.
Hatari!	48	57	The next morning, Dallas has vanished, leaving a farewell letter with Pockets.
Hatari!	49	57	Sean and the group rush to Arusha to catch her.
Hatari!	50	57	To help locate Dallas they take along one of the baby elephants, to track her by scent.
Hatari!	51	57	Not wanting to be left behind, the other two follow the truck to Arusha.
Hatari!	52	57	The ensuing chase ends when the elephants corner Dallas in a hotel lobby.
Hatari!	53	57	In the final scene, Dallas is again in Sean's bed when he enters the room, and they reprise the dialogue from their first meeting.
Hatari!	54	57	As before, Pockets also comes in drunk and again asks Sean "What is she doing in your bed.
Hatari!	55	57	" But this time, Sean announces "We got married today.
Hatari!	56	57	" After Sean herds Pockets out of their room, Tembo and his two brothers push their way in and break Sean's bed as the newlyweds try to figure out how to deal with them.

Keeping the Faith	3	35	Rabbi Jacob "Jake" Schram (Ben Stiller), best friends with Brian since childhood, is the youngest rabbi at his Conservative synagogue; his lack of effort to find a Jewish wife often results in his mother, Ruth (Anne Bancroft) and other women of his congregation setting him up on blind dates, much to his dismay.
Keeping the Faith	4	35	The two men show a close bond, even in their professions, where the two are planning the opening of a jointly sponsored community center.
Keeping the Faith	5	35	In its earlier days, the friendship included a third party.
Keeping the Faith	6	35	Via flashbacks and reminiscent musings, Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman) is introduced: she met Jake and Brian in middle school, after beating up a bully who was picking on them.
Keeping the Faith	7	35	The three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together.
Keeping the Faith	8	35	Unfortunately, Anna's father got a new job that resulted in the Reillys moving to California, and ultimately she lost touch with Brian and Jake.
Keeping the Faith	9	35	Sixteen years later, Anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a New York position.
Keeping the Faith	10	35	Feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as Anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as Brian and Jake remembered her; however, it is, ironically, the men's careers that prove to be the most problematic.
Keeping the Faith	11	35	She and Jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not Jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - Jake's older brother Ethan - for marrying outside the faith).
Keeping the Faith	12	35	Between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications.
Keeping the Faith	13	35	As the months pass, both Jake and Anna's feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, Jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite Anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of Jake's congregation while on a date and Jake introducing her only as "my old friend Anna".
Keeping the Faith	14	35	Meanwhile, Brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for Anna despite his vows.
Keeping the Faith	15	35	Apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with Fr.
Keeping the Faith	16	35	Havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself.
Keeping the Faith	17	35	Brian begins misinterpreting Anna's words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to Jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her.
Keeping the Faith	18	35	Anna tells Jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well.
Keeping the Faith	19	35	While the three have dinner one night with Jake's mother Ruth, Ruth has a private conversation with Anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about Anna and Jake's secret relationship.
Keeping the Faith	20	35	Jake and Brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later Jake and Anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration.
Keeping the Faith	21	35	Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment.
Keeping the Faith	22	35	Still unaware of what's been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love.
Keeping the Faith	23	35	When she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with Jake and finally admits that she and Jake have been seeing each other secretly for months.
Keeping the Faith	24	35	Feeling embarrassed and rejected, Brian raids Anna's liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize.
Keeping the Faith	25	35	He leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets.
Keeping the Faith	26	35	The next day, still drunk, Brian stumbles into Jake's temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with Jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi.
Keeping the Faith	27	35	He leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.
Keeping the Faith	28	35	As the Community Center's grand opening approaches, along with the last days of Anna's East Coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with Jake reconciling with Brian, followed by Anna reconciling with Brian shortly after.
Keeping the Faith	29	35	A discussion between the two men prompts Jake to go to Anna's office building, with Brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street.
Keeping the Faith	30	35	Jake interrupts Anna's going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right.
Keeping the Faith	31	35	Later that evening, they surprise Brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start.
Keeping the Faith	32	35	Anna greets Rabbi Lewis (Eli Wallach) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that Anna had told Jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to convert to Judaism.
Keeping the Faith	33	35	She tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in New York, with Jake clearly thrilled.
Keeping the Faith	34	35	The film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.

Summer Lovers	6	42	One day, at the beach without Cathy, he gets his chance to talk to Lina and ends up starting an affair with her.
Summer Lovers	7	42	He then feels so guilty that Cathy immediately notices something is wrong, and he admits what he has done, insisting that he still loves Cathy.
Summer Lovers	8	42	Cathy is naturally disturbed by this, but tells him to get it out of his system, which he takes as permission to return to Lina.
Summer Lovers	9	42	Cathy then goes to a local bar intending to sleep with another man as a way to get revenge against Michael for cheating on her.
Summer Lovers	10	42	But in the end she chickens out after getting picked up by an amorous local boy.

Summer Lovers	22	42	The three end up spending the night together.
Summer Lovers	23	42	Lina moves in with them, and they continue enjoying the island paradise as a threesome.
Summer Lovers	24	42	Just as the fantasy seems to be a total success, the natural complications of domestic life, like who does the laundry or dishes, come to the foreground.
Summer Lovers	25	42	The three work through these problems, but then Cathy's mother (Barbara Rush) appears on a surprise visit, snapping everyone back to reality.
Summer Lovers	26	42	Cathy tells her mother she's never been happier in her life.
Summer Lovers	27	42	Although Lina claims to be bad at relationships and prefers just "screwing", the three actually seem to be falling in love all around.
Summer Lovers	28	42	Aside from Lina's comment that she prefers just "screwing," the sexually charged plot is underscored by a number of other instances of openly sexual comments and humor.
Summer Lovers	29	42	For example, when Cathy's mother comes to visit and is checking into a hotel on the island, the desk clerk asks a woman checking out "how many douches did you have ma'am.

Summer Lovers	36	42	Eventually they conclude they won't find her as long as she wants to remain hidden.
Summer Lovers	37	42	But their memories of Lina loom over everything they try to do, and they can no longer enjoy their time on the island.
Summer Lovers	38	42	They pack up to return home, even though they have three weeks remaining prepaid on their rental.
Summer Lovers	39	42	Lina finds her fears are outweighed by her feelings for the Americans, and returns to reunite with them, only to discover they have already gone.

Other People's Money	1	23	With the help of a computerized stock analyzing program called Carmen, Garfield has identified New England Wire & Cable as his next target.
Other People's Money	2	23	The struggling company is run by the benevolent and folksy Andrew "Jorgy" Jorgenson (Gregory Peck) and is the primary employer in its small Rhode Island town.
Other People's Money	3	23	After stubbornly insisting that no outsider can seize control of a business his father began, Jorgy is finally persuaded to hire his stepdaughter Kate (Penelope Ann Miller), a big-city lawyer, to defend against a hostile takeover.
Other People's Money	4	23	Garfield is instantly smitten with the beautiful Kate, although he is on to her tactics and does not waver from his goal of becoming the majority stockholder of New England Wire & Cable.
Other People's Money	5	23	Garfield tactlessly and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her.
Other People's Money	6	23	Despite their antagonism, Kate finds herself attracted to Garfield's bold nature.
Other People's Money	7	23	The takeover attempt begins to fracture the New England Wire & Cable family.
Other People's Money	8	23	Kate's mother Bea (Piper Laurie) secretly travels to Garfield's offices to offer one million dollars in greenmail to Garfield if he'll go away, but he refuses, stating, "I don't take money from widows or orphans".
Other People's Money	9	23	Trusted company president Bill Coles (Dean Jones), fearful that the takeover will leave him with nothing, offers to let Garfield vote his shares in the company in exchange for a million-dollar payout.
Other People's Money	10	23	Garfield agrees, but specifies that Coles will get only half as much if his shares fail to make up the margin of victory.
Other People's Money	11	23	Garfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting.
Other People's Money	12	23	Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money.
Other People's Money	13	23	The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal.
Other People's Money	14	23	In his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire & Cable to the last buggy whip manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete.
Other People's Money	15	23	Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise.
Other People's Money	16	23	At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.
Other People's Money	17	23	When the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company.
Other People's Money	18	23	The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get.
Other People's Money	19	23	Back at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate.
Other People's Money	20	23	Just then, Kate calls.
Other People's Money	21	23	She's been having discussions with a Japanese automaker that wants to hire New England Wire & Cable to manufacture stainless steel wire cloth for making airbags, something which will make the company profitable again.

The Butcher's Wife	1	10	When New York butcher Leo Lemke shows up on the tiny North Carolina island of Ocracoke, where Marina lives, she is convinced that he is the man predestined to be her husband.
The Butcher's Wife	2	10	After the wedding, Marina moves into Leo's blue-collar neighborhood, where she successfully commiserates with such eccentrics as withdrawn teenager Eugene, frustrated singer Stella Keefover, unlucky-in-love actress Robyn Graves, over analytical psychiatrist dr Alex Tremor, and closeted lesbian dress shop clerk Grace.
The Butcher's Wife	3	10	But what Marina fails to grasp about her powers is that she can see the future of strangers far more clearly than her own, and love is unpredictable no matter how many ways you have to look for it.
The Butcher's Wife	4	10	The film makes use of several phenomena that can be described as occult portents that meeting a love match is imminent or occult tools to help strengthen, seal or bring about love, luck and happiness.
The Butcher's Wife	5	10	These include the sudden "finding" of a ring that would serve as a wedding band, falling stars with twin tails, zig-zagged rainbows and found objects symbolizing a change in the finder's path that will cause it to cross with their beloved.
The Butcher's Wife	6	10	It also popularizes, as the character of Alex Tremor calls it, "a corruption" of a section of Plato's Symposium regarding soul mates, referred to in the movie as "split aparts".
The Butcher's Wife	7	10	In one scene, dr Tremor notes an aspect of Marina's visions, and Marina says: "Women have been burned for less".
The Butcher's Wife	8	10	This is a reference to the witch persecutions in Europe and America between the 15th and 19th centuries, the most famous of which were the Salem Witch Trials, although no "witches" were burned in the Salem hysteria.
The Butcher's Wife	9	10	Lastly, it also references common-use bastardizations of voodoo practices, such as "mojo" bags (or gris gris) and the use of chickens or toads.

Herbie Rides Again	1	30	His only obstacle is the 1892 firehouse inhabited by "Grandma" Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz; her displaced neighbor, flight attendant Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers); and their sentient machines: a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle known as Herbie, "the Love Bug;" an early 19th-century orchestrion that plays on its own; and a retired cable car from the defunct Clay Street Line, known as "Old No.
Herbie Rides Again	2	30	22".
Herbie Rides Again	3	30	mrs Steinmetz explains that Tennessee has gone to Tibet to visit his ailing philosophy teacher, while Herbie's former owner, Jim Douglas, has gone to Europe.
Herbie Rides Again	4	30	Hawk has made numerous attempts at evicting mrs Steinmetz, intending to imprison her in a retirement home of his own making; but Hawk's lawyers have been unsuccessful in these attempts, and when his lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) comes to visit him, Hawk sends him to mrs Steinmetz in their stead.
Herbie Rides Again	5	30	Having met the firehouse's inhabitants, Willoughby becomes disillusioned and decides to return home to Missouri.
Herbie Rides Again	6	30	Nicole also punches Willoughby in the face upon learning he works for Hawk.
Herbie Rides Again	7	30	She offers him a ride in Herbie, and Herbie goes berserk after Willboughy insults him twice, eventually taking the two to a car version of a joust tournament, which Herbie wins, earning Willboughy a whooping $300.
Herbie Rides Again	8	30	The two then go to lunch, but Nicole hits Willboughy with a broiled lobster when he spits out that Hawk is his uncle - after going through an uninterrupted monologue on all the horrible things Hawk has done, including building a parking garage on the very same lot where Joe DiMaggio and his brothers learned to play baseball.
Herbie Rides Again	9	30	Having lost him, Hawk attempts to capture Herbie; but when Hawk insults him, Herbie causes a series of traffic collisions and discards Hawk at his own office door, where Hawk orders his subordinates to capture Herbie again, followed by a policeman giving Hawk several tickets for traffic offenses.

Herbie Rides Again	11	30	Willoughby having decided to go home in disguise, he is convinced by Nicole to stay after she hears him criticize his uncle while talking to his mother on the telephone.

Herbie Rides Again	14	30	22" with mrs Steinmetz riding along, while Nicole and Willoughby follow in Herbie.

Herbie Rides Again	16	30	22," thinking himself on a public cable car.

Herbie Rides Again	18	30	22" rolls down a hill.
Herbie Rides Again	19	30	During this time, mrs Steinmetz becomes enamored with Judson.
Herbie Rides Again	20	30	Hawk thereafter recruits an independent demolition agent named Loostgarten (Chuck McCann); while Mrs Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself.
Herbie Rides Again	21	30	Accompanied by Willoughby, she drives Herbie onto the window-cleaning machine of Hawk‚Äôs skyscraper to reach his 28th-floor office, where mrs Steinmetz overhears a telephoned conversation with Loostgarten about the deal to demolish the firehouse and activates the window cleaning machine to fill the office with foam and water.
Herbie Rides Again	22	30	This done, Herbie pursues Hawk around the building's perimeter - even following him outside onto a ledge - until Mrs Steinmetz orders him to desist.
Herbie Rides Again	23	30	Disguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby directs Loostgarten to demolish Hawk's own house.
Herbie Rides Again	24	30	Loostgarten then telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from several nightmares showing himself at the mercy of Herbie; whereupon Hawk gives confirmation, but realizes too that he has ordered demolition of his own residence and attacks Loostgarten after a portion of his house is collapsed from a wrecking ball.
Herbie Rides Again	25	30	In the morning, Hawk calls a truce with mrs Steinmetz, and thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner, while mrs Steinmetz invites Judson to a similar meeting; but Hawk violates the truce by sending earthmovers to crush the firehouse and its inhabitants, prompting Herbie to go in search of Nicole and Willoughby.
Herbie Rides Again	26	30	In the absence of Herbie, the only means of defense is an antique Fire hose, which Judson uses against the earthmovers.
Herbie Rides Again	27	30	Having obtained Nicole and Willoughby, Herbie rounds up several other Volkswagen Beetles from various places in the city, and comes after Hawk and his men as an army and ruin his scheme.
Herbie Rides Again	28	30	Hawk is pursued from the grounds by Herbie, and arrested by the police.
Herbie Rides Again	29	30	Later, Nicole and Willoughby are married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his new Volkswagen Beetle friends.

Solid Serenade	0	29	Near a house is a doghouse labeled "Killer" with a dog (Spike) in it.
Solid Serenade	1	29	Tom pokes his head over the wall and spots a female cat (Toodles Galore) in the window.
Solid Serenade	2	29	Tom brings along his string instrument (possibly a double bass or cello), then wakes up Spike and neutralizes him by whacking him in the head with a mallet and tying him up.
Solid Serenade	3	29	Tom uses his instrument as a pogo stick to hop over to the window, stopping halfway to taunt Spike along the way.
Solid Serenade	4	29	Tom plays "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby"; the sound waves from the instrument shake Jerry's mousehole, bouncing Jerry off the bed, then under the table, and Jerry's head is hit by a vase that falls off the table when the mouse comes out the other side.
Solid Serenade	5	29	Having had enough, the mouse gets his revenge by going into the kitchen and hurling a pie with an iron stuffed inside; the cat is angered, but continues with a few more bars.
Solid Serenade	6	29	Seconds later, he is hit in the face again ‚Äì this time with a pie covered in whipped cream.
Solid Serenade	7	29	Spotting Jerry, Tom chases him through the house.

Solid Serenade	9	29	Tom follows Jerry through the open window, but Jerry pulls the window stop out of the window.
Solid Serenade	10	29	The window falls on Tom's neck, and Tom shrieks in pain.
Solid Serenade	11	29	Jerry then runs out and unties Spike, and the dog lets out a loud bull roar, which starts a new chase.
Solid Serenade	12	29	Spike swaps his small teeth for "heavy-duty" ones, blows off some pent-up steam, and goes after Tom.
Solid Serenade	13	29	Tom ducks as Spike's teeth come at him, which instead get lodged in a tree trunk.
Solid Serenade	14	29	Tom then barely avoids getting his tail bitten and hides behind a wall, holding a brick up ready to attack.
Solid Serenade	15	29	Spike sees the brick and investigates, but gets knocked on the head with it.
Solid Serenade	16	29	With his ally eliminated, Jerry revives Spike by hitting him with a wooden plank.
Solid Serenade	17	29	After slamming Spike, Spike leaps high in the air screaming in pain just as Jerry hands off the board to Tom, framing the cat.

Solid Serenade	21	29	Tom stops periodically to kiss the cat.

Solid Serenade	23	29	Tom stops his speech abruptly when he sees the female cat and, realizing his mistake, drops Spike onto the floor.
Solid Serenade	24	29	Tom hides from Spike's rampage until Jerry walks around the corner; he chases Jerry to Spike's house, which Jerry immediately hides in.
Solid Serenade	25	29	Tom then sneaks into the doghouse with a murderous Dracula laugh while closing the door, indicating that something most foul is going to occur.
Solid Serenade	26	29	A second later, the door opens and Spike pokes his head out, helps Jerry out of his house and laughs even more evilly as he withdraws inside to.
Solid Serenade	27	29	The entire dog house thrashes about as Spike beats up Tom, who at one point quickly writes his will before being wrenched back in and beaten to within an inch of his life.
Solid Serenade	28	29	At the end, Toodles Galore watches Spike strum Tom, who had replaced the strings on his instrument, while Jerry plays a quick riff on Tom's whiskers.

The Lemon Drop Kid	3	44	When the horse finishes dead last, a furious Moran demands the Kid pay him $10,000 (the amount he would have won) by Christmas Eve, or the Kid "won't make it to New Year's".

The Lemon Drop Kid	15	44	Organizing other small-time New York swindlers and Brainey, who is both surprised and charmed at the Kid's apparent goodwill, the Kid converts an abandoned casino (ironically belonging to Moose Moran) into the "Nellie Thursday Home For Old Dolls".

The Lemon Drop Kid	17	44	The Kid receives the all-important city license.

The Lemon Drop Kid	24	44	Reasoning that the Nellie Thursday home is "wherever Nellie Thursday is", Oxford Charlie and his crew kidnap the home's inhabitants (including Nellie and Brainey) and move them to Charlie's mansion in Nyack.

The Lemon Drop Kid	28	44	However, Brainey tracks him down and voices her disgust.
The Lemon Drop Kid	29	44	After a few days of stewing in self-pity (and realizing it is Christmas Eve), the Kid is surprised to meet Nellie, who has escaped.
The Lemon Drop Kid	30	44	He decides to recover the money, sneaking into Charlie's home in the guise of an elderly woman.
The Lemon Drop Kid	31	44	He finds that Charlie and his crew are moving the women to a more secure location.
The Lemon Drop Kid	32	44	The Kid confronts Charlie in his office.
The Lemon Drop Kid	33	44	After a brief struggle, the Kid overpowers Charlie and makes off with the money, narrowly avoiding the thugs Charlie has sent after him.
The Lemon Drop Kid	34	44	The ensuing chaos allows Brainey and the others to escape.
The Lemon Drop Kid	35	44	Later that night, the Kid returns to the original Nellie Thursday home to meet with Moose Moran.
The Lemon Drop Kid	36	44	The deal appears to be in jeopardy as Moran arrives with Charlie.
The Lemon Drop Kid	37	44	Charlie demands that the Kid reimburse him, which would leave too little for Moran.
The Lemon Drop Kid	38	44	However, the Kid hits a switch, revealing hidden casino tables.
The Lemon Drop Kid	39	44	All are occupied, mainly by the escaped women.
The Lemon Drop Kid	40	44	The Kid and his still-loyal friends hold off the gangsters as the police initiate a raid.
The Lemon Drop Kid	41	44	Moran and Oxford Charlie are arrested.

Me and You and Everyone We Know	15	17	When asked why he is doing it, he stops and turns around, saying "just passing the time", and gives Robby the quarter.

It Should Happen to You	0	72	The script, by Garson Kanin, is about a naive young woman named Gladys Glover who yearns for fame.
It Should Happen to You	1	72	Strolling through Central Park, she meets a young handsome man named Pete Sheppard (Jack Lemmon).
It Should Happen to You	2	72	He is a maker of documentaries (apparently equipped only with a handheld 16mm camera).
It Should Happen to You	3	72	He is taking brief shots of people in the park.
It Should Happen to You	4	72	He films Gladys feeding pigeons and introduces himself.
It Should Happen to You	5	72	In a rapid piece of exposition, we learn Gladys has been in New York City for two years, coming from a job at a shoe factory in Binghamton, New York.
It Should Happen to You	6	72	She has just lost her job as a model of girdles, because her hip size is 3/4" larger than it should be, and still has the $1000, which she "saved up".
It Should Happen to You	7	72	Gladys is discouraged at having gotten nowhere in two years and she wants to make a name for herself.
It Should Happen to You	8	72	It is clear Pete is taken by Gladys.
It Should Happen to You	9	72	He gets her address by offering to drop her a postcard when the documentary is finished so she can see herself in it.
It Should Happen to You	10	72	"Really.
It Should Happen to You	11	72	" she says, "I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies".
It Should Happen to You	12	72	"You don't need to give me your right arm," says Pete, "just give me your right address".
It Should Happen to You	13	72	Pete encourages Gladys to follow her dreams: "Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a way there is a will".
It Should Happen to You	14	72	The two then part ways.
It Should Happen to You	15	72	Wandering despondently, Gladys' attention is caught by a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle with the notice, "This space for rent.
It Should Happen to You	16	72	Choice location.
It Should Happen to You	17	72	Inquire Horace Pfeiffer Co, 383 Madison Avenue".
It Should Happen to You	18	72	She fantasizes about her name being on the billboard and gathering up the nerve she goes to 383 Madison Avenue to inquire about the billboard.
It Should Happen to You	19	72	Gladys asks for "Mr.
It Should Happen to You	20	72	Horace Puh-feiffer," pronouncing the letter P, and is corrected by the receptionist who tells her there is no mr Pfeiffer.
It Should Happen to You	21	72	Determined, Gladys obtains an interview with a busy man conducting a telephone conversation, who brusquely tells her the sign is available, demands to know "whom she represents," and says "I'm really too busy for this sort of thing".
It Should Happen to You	22	72	The spunky Gladys pulls $1000 in cash from her purse, complains that the man is too "stuck up" to listen to her, asks "What sort of place treats people that way" and starts to leave.
It Should Happen to You	23	72	The representative relents and tells her the sign is $210 per month, three months minimum.
It Should Happen to You	24	72	Gladys pays $630 in cash and arranges to have her name put on the billboard.
It Should Happen to You	25	72	Within a few days the sign is up and she is thrilled.
It Should Happen to You	26	72	However, it turns out the Adams Soap company has traditionally booked the sign and is upset to learn that another client has obtained it.
It Should Happen to You	27	72	The Pfeiffer company calls Gladys to a meeting where Evan Adams III (Lawford) attempts to induce her to give up the sign by offering her more money.
It Should Happen to You	28	72	Gladys is not interested.
It Should Happen to You	29	72	She is called to another meeting and is offered six signs in exchange for the one.
It Should Happen to You	30	72	This time, she accepts.
It Should Happen to You	31	72	Now, there are six huge signs in New York, one in lights, each saying simply "Gladys Glover".
It Should Happen to You	32	72	Meanwhile, Pete Sheppard has taken an apartment adjacent to Gladys, a move which does not seem to rouse her curiosity, and the two become platonic friends.
It Should Happen to You	33	72	Sheppard is, however, exasperated by Gladys' fascination with her signs and her requests he tour the city with her to see them.
It Should Happen to You	34	72	Citygoers are intrigued by the mysterious signs.
It Should Happen to You	35	72	Gladys shops in a department store (Macy's), and when she gives her name, the word spreads quickly and dozens of people flock around to get the autograph of the famous Gladys Glover.
It Should Happen to You	36	72	Soon, she is being asked to appear on television shows.
It Should Happen to You	37	72	However, the round of publicity begns to take an unpleasant turn.
It Should Happen to You	38	72	Gladys explains she obtained the signs simply in order to, "Make a name for herself," but does not seem to be aware she is being treated as a figure of fun.
It Should Happen to You	39	72	Evan Adams III, however, decides she is ripe for exploitation as, "The average American girl," and hires her to do a series of advertisements for Adams Soap.
It Should Happen to You	40	72	As Gladys pursues what is becoming a lucrative career, relations between her and Pete become strained.
It Should Happen to You	41	72	At the same time, Adams is showing an increasing interest in her.
It Should Happen to You	42	72	The situation reaches a crisis when Gladys breaks a date with Pete in order to attend what Adams says is a business conference to discuss a cross-country publicity tour.
It Should Happen to You	43	72	The conference turns out to be an attempted seduction.
It Should Happen to You	44	72	As Adams reaches to embrace Gladys, she accidentally or intentionally spills a full glass of champagne down the back his neck, breaking the spell.
It Should Happen to You	45	72	Gladys says, "I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly.
It Should Happen to You	46	72	What I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled".
It Should Happen to You	47	72	Adam then says, "Maybe I am.
It Should Happen to You	48	72	Oh, sure, if you want to make it into a sort of business proposition.
It Should Happen to You	49	72	That's what you're doing, isn't it.

It Should Happen to You	51	72	The people who will do anything to make a name for themselves, and the people who will do almost anything.
It Should Happen to You	52	72	Soon there will be signs all over saying I'm the average American girl.
It Should Happen to You	53	72	That was your idea wasn't it.
It Should Happen to You	54	72	Well, I don't think the average American girl should do.
It Should Happen to You	55	72	this" then Gladys walks out.
It Should Happen to You	56	72	When she arrives home she finds a 16&nbsp;mm movie projector in her room with a note from Pete telling her to run it.
It Should Happen to You	57	72	A film plays complete with titles and synchronized sound, entitled "Goodby, [sic] Gladys".
It Should Happen to You	58	72	The charmingly self-deprecating Pete confesses he loves Gladys, acknowledges that his profile is not as good looking as Adams', and says goodbye.
It Should Happen to You	59	72	Gladys' advertising career continues, but she finds its emptiness more and more frustrating.
It Should Happen to You	60	72	She recalls Pete's frequent questions as to why she wants to be above the crowd instead of being happy being part of the crowd.
It Should Happen to You	61	72	In the meantime, Pete continues to make a go of his documentary film career.
It Should Happen to You	62	72	In a cage at a zoo, he makes a documentary showing how the visitors appear to the animals.

It Should Happen to You	64	72	Suddenly, the crowd's attention is distracted by the sound of an airplane.

Out to Sea	0	25	Compulsive gambler Charlie Gordon, cons his close friend and brother-in-law, widower Herb Sullivan, whose recently deceased wife, Susie Gordon-Sullivan, was Charlie's sister, into an all expenses-paid luxury Holland America Mexican cruise.
Out to Sea	1	25	The catch, which Charlie does not reveal to Herb until the ship has left port, is that they are required to work as dance hosts and must sleep in a cramped cabin in the bowels of the ship.
Out to Sea	2	25	If they don't not dance, they will get fired and have to pay nearly up 3,000 dollars for the cruise, or get thrown off the ship.
Out to Sea	3	25	Ruled over by tyrannical, control-freak cruise director Gil Godwyn ("a song and dance man raised on a military base"), they do their best, despite Charlie's not actually being able to dance.
Out to Sea	4	25	Each meets a lady of interest.
Out to Sea	5	25	One is the luscious heiress Liz LaBreche, whose wealth attracts Charlie every bit as much as the rest of her does.
Out to Sea	6	25	The other is lovely widow Vivian who was a successful book editor, who is under the impression that Herb is really a doctor, not a dancer.
Out to Sea	7	25	Liz came on board on the ship with his daughter and her newlywed husband to help her start dating again.
Out to Sea	8	25	After finally telling her the truth, Herb soon finds himself quite attracted to Vivian, and eventually the feeling becomes mutual.
Out to Sea	9	25	However, because Herb still pines for the day Susie will suddenly come back to him, this conflicts his very strong feelings for Vivian, leading him to eventually stand her up on the day that they were supposed to view the rare solar eclipse together.
Out to Sea	10	25	Herb doesn't know that Vivian is broke and he came on board this ship, to land a rich man.
Out to Sea	11	25	Herb decides against starting a new relationship with Vivian until Charlie reminds that Susie was his sister, long before she was Herb's wife, emphasizing that Susie would never want Herb to spend the rest of his life completely alone and unhappy.
Out to Sea	12	25	(Charlie: "Will you stop using Susie as a safety net.
Out to Sea	13	25	" Herb: "Wait a minute.
Out to Sea	14	25	Who in the hell are you to tell me.
Out to Sea	15	25	" Charlie: "She was my sister before she was your wife.
Out to Sea	16	25	And if she were here now, she'd tell ya the same thing".
Out to Sea	17	25	Herb: "Ah, but she is not here now, is she Charlie.
Out to Sea	18	25	She's gone".
Out to Sea	19	25	Charlie: "That's right Herb, but you're not".
Out to Sea	20	25	).
Out to Sea	21	25	By the time Charlie literally drags ship owner mrs Carruthers across the dance floor, the boys aren't sure if they will find true love or need to abandon ship.
Out to Sea	22	25	Liz and her mother are revealed to be gold-digging frauds, just like Charlie, but as they make their getaway with Vivian on a plane, Herb and Charlie call out to all to come back.
Out to Sea	23	25	Charlie and Liz still continue dating, but Charlie made some good money that he won on a poker game from a rich guy.
Out to Sea	24	25	Herb is now dating Vivan now.
Champagne for Caesar	0	55	Beauregard Bottomley (Ronald Colman) is an unemployed PhD physicist who lives in Los Angeles with his piano-instructor sister Gwenn (Barbara Britton) and the alcohol-guzzling parrot of the film's title, Caesar (Mel Blanc, voice).
Champagne for Caesar	1	55	Beauregard and Gwenn live in a bungalow court, surrounded by books.
Champagne for Caesar	2	55	Beauregard is an omnivorous reader, and is highly knowledgeable on virtually any subject - except, as he admits, how to hold a job.
Champagne for Caesar	3	55	Beauregard obtains word of a mysterious job opportunity at the Milady Soap Company.
Champagne for Caesar	4	55	He meets the eccentric company owner, Burnbridge Waters (Vincent Price), for the job interview.
Champagne for Caesar	5	55	Waters disapproves of Beauregard's humour and turns him down for the job, humiliating him in the process.
Champagne for Caesar	6	55	Later, in front of an appliance store window, Beauregard, Gwenn and a small crowd, none of whom have TV sets yet, watch the radio quiz show - just transferred to the new medium of television - Masquerade for Money, whose sponsor is Milady Soap.
Champagne for Caesar	7	55	The show's format features contestants costumed as historical characters or items, who are asked questions about who or what their attire represents.
Champagne for Caesar	8	55	The prize doubles with each successive question, in the style of the 1940s radio show The $64 Question.
Champagne for Caesar	9	55	If anyone misses just one question, the contestant loses all that was won to that point.
Champagne for Caesar	10	55	Beauregard is contemptuous of television and what he deems as its anti-intellectual nature, after seeing Masquarade for Money.
Champagne for Caesar	11	55	However, after seeing the contestants struggle to answer relatively easy questions, Beauregard plots revenge on Burnbridge Waters.
Champagne for Caesar	12	55	He goes on the program dressed as an encyclopedia to let the host know he will answer any question given to him by the show's host, Happy Hogan (Art Linkletter).
Champagne for Caesar	13	55	Starting from an initial $5 prize, Beauregard easily answers the maximum five questions, then asks for a sixth question.
Champagne for Caesar	14	55	The show runs out of time, but Beauregard promises to come back the next week if people will write in to Milady Soap demanding he be allowed to return.
Champagne for Caesar	15	55	An avalanche of mail inspires Burnbridge Waters.
Champagne for Caesar	16	55	He decides to call Bottomley back for one question per show - and when they've reached a new high in soap sales, the show will drop him.
Champagne for Caesar	17	55	Masquerade for Money becomes a ratings triumph.
Champagne for Caesar	18	55	The country tunes in each week to watch Beauregard, who appears with Caesar on the covers of Look and Life Magazines.
Champagne for Caesar	19	55	The questions become more erudite and challenging, but Bottomley keeps answering them with ease.
Champagne for Caesar	20	55	With Beauregard's continuing success and increasing prize amount, Waters becomes uneasy, as the winnings will potentially erode Milady's profits.
Champagne for Caesar	21	55	Visiting the soap factory one day, Beauregard finally explains to Waters that his ultimate goal is, first, to break Waters by winning $40 million - the entire worth of Milady Soap - and thus drive Waters into bankruptcy.
Champagne for Caesar	22	55	As Beauregard continues to answer the questions, Waters calls in "Flame" O'Neill (Celeste Holm) to try to weaken Waters via seduction, to find a subject where his knowledge is lacking.
Champagne for Caesar	23	55	In parallel, Happy Hogan tries to work his charms on Gwenn to see if he also can persuade her to have Beauregard simply pocket his winnings to date, by taking piano lessons with her and asking her out.
Champagne for Caesar	24	55	Beauregard has become ill with a cold, and Flame insinuates herself into the Bottomley household as Beauregard's nurse, pretending to be a member of his fan club.
Champagne for Caesar	25	55	With little past experience with women, Beauregard initially succumbs to Flame's charms, and loses his general sang-froid in her presence.
Champagne for Caesar	26	55	Gwenn is suspicious of Flame's motives, as Beauregard is suspicious of Hogan's motives in suddenly taking piano lessons with her.
Champagne for Caesar	27	55	Neither sibling is to be deterred by the other from their respective romantic attachments.
Champagne for Caesar	28	55	Flame, a la Delilah, intends to seduce Bottomley to find out his Achilles' heel, a subject that will stump him.
Champagne for Caesar	29	55	Slowly, Beauregard becomes suspicious of Flame, after his recovery.
Champagne for Caesar	30	55	He reveals to her on one date that he (supposedly) never quite mastered Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
Champagne for Caesar	31	55	With that knowledge, the next question on Masquerade for Money is for Beauregard to explain Einstein's theory.
Champagne for Caesar	32	55	Now realizing Flame's role in the situation, Beauregard does struggle for an answer, which he provides.
Champagne for Caesar	33	55	However, Happy Hogan indicates that, by his answer card, the response is wrong.
Champagne for Caesar	34	55	Waters rejoices as the studio audience groans, and Beauregard wanders into the wings, apparently defeated.
Champagne for Caesar	35	55	However, a phone call arrives a moment later, from Einstein himself, who has been watching the show.
Champagne for Caesar	36	55	Einstein explains that in fact, Bottomley gave the correct answer.
Champagne for Caesar	37	55	Hogan announces the news to a now jubilant audience.
Champagne for Caesar	38	55	Waters faints, and Bottomley is to return next week.
Champagne for Caesar	39	55	In the meantime, Happy appears to have genuinely fallen in love with Gwenn.
Champagne for Caesar	40	55	Flame also has apparently developed some remorse at her part in the plot against Beauregard, and also affection for him.
Champagne for Caesar	41	55	Waters decides to rent the Hollywood Bowl for the final question of the final show.
Champagne for Caesar	42	55	Before the last show, with the prize stakes at $20 million, Beauregard and Gwenn decide to test each other's romantic partners and respective engagements.
Champagne for Caesar	43	55	Each sibling telephones the respective partner to see if they would be willing to be married before the big prize day.
Champagne for Caesar	44	55	Happy and Flame each come up with excuses for not marrying Gwenn and Beauregard before the last prize show, which deflates both siblings.
Champagne for Caesar	45	55	At the Hollywood Bowl, after a sardonic introduction from Waters, Beauregard comes onstage, where Happy asks for his wallet.
Champagne for Caesar	46	55	Happy then asks a very simple question about Beauregard himself, and not about any subject in a book, namely, what is Beauregard's Social Security number.
Champagne for Caesar	47	55	Beauregard answers incorrectly, to the tremendous relief of Waters and the disappointment of the crowd.
Champagne for Caesar	48	55	Back home, Beauregard and Gwenn appear disappointed.
Champagne for Caesar	49	55	However, later that evening, Happy and Flame appear, willing to marry Gwenn and Beauregard respectively after all.
Champagne for Caesar	50	55	Waters also appears, with gifts for Beauregard.
Champagne for Caesar	51	55	It turns out that Caesar used to be Waters' pet parrot.
Champagne for Caesar	52	55	As Beauregard and Flame drive off to be married, Beauregard reveals that he and Waters agreed to a backroom deal where he would lose, but receive his own radio show, as well as Milady Soap stock.
Champagne for Caesar	53	55	However, Beauregard then admits that he genuinely didn't know the answer to the simple question posed to him at the Hollywood Bowl.
Champagne for Caesar	54	55	Even so, most anyone watching the movie might well think Beauregard must have known the answer, or else he could not have completed any job applications requiring that information.
Defending Your Life	0	24	Daniel Miller (Albert Brooks), a Los Angeles advertising executive, dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to the afterlife.
Defending Your Life	1	24	He arrives in Judgment City, a Purgatory-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased of the western half of the United States, where he is to undergo the process of having his life on Earth judged.
Defending Your Life	2	24	Daniel and the rest of the recently deceased are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities in the city while they undergo their judgment processes‚Äîfrom all-you-can-eat restaurants (which cause no weight gain and serve the best food), to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.
Defending Your Life	3	24	His defense attorney, Bob Diamond (Rip Torn), explains to Daniel that people from Earth use so little of their brains (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their fears.
Defending Your Life	4	24	"When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me," says Diamond.
Defending Your Life	5	24	If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer.
Defending Your Life	6	24	Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.
Defending Your Life	7	24	Daniel's judgment process is presided over by two judges (played by Lillian Lehman and George Wallace).
Defending Your Life	8	24	Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase.
Defending Your Life	9	24	His formidable opponent is Lena Foster (Lee Grant).
Defending Your Life	10	24	Diamond informs Daniel that she is known as "the Dragon Lady".
Defending Your Life	11	24	Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in the defendants' lives, shown to the judges to illustrate their case.
Defending Your Life	12	24	During the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia (Meryl Streep), a woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his.
Defending Your Life	13	24	(She died after slipping on the ground and falling into her pool and drowning) The proceedings do not go well for Daniel.
Defending Your Life	14	24	Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps.
Defending Your Life	15	24	The final nail in his coffin, it seems, is when Foster, on the last day of arguments, plays footage of his previous night with Julia, in which he declines to sleep with her, for what Foster believes is his same fear and lack of courage.
Defending Your Life	16	24	It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth.
Defending Your Life	17	24	Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on.
Defending Your Life	18	24	Before saying goodbye Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right.
Defending Your Life	19	24	Daniel remains disappointed.
Defending Your Life	20	24	Daniel finds himself strapped to a seat on a tram poised to return to Earth, when he spots Julia on a different tram.
Defending Your Life	21	24	On impulse, he unstraps himself, escapes from the moving tram, and risks electrocution and injury to get to Julia.
Defending Your Life	22	24	Although he cannot enter her tram at first, the entire event is being monitored by Foster and Diamond, who convinces the judges that this last-minute display of courage has earned Daniel the right to move on.
Defending Your Life	23	24	The judges agree and open the doors on Julia‚Äôs tram, allowing Daniel in, reuniting him with Julia, and allowing them to move on to the next phase of existence together.

Doc Hollywood	0	26	Dr.
Doc Hollywood	1	26	Benjamin Stone is a promising young surgeon working in Washington,C.
Doc Hollywood	2	26	with plans of making more money working for a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon.
Doc Hollywood	3	26	On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult made out of icing.
Doc Hollywood	4	26	Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina.
Doc Hollywood	5	26	The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone pay for the fence with cash.
Doc Hollywood	6	26	Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker.
Doc Hollywood	7	26	Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car.
Doc Hollywood	8	26	Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers.
Doc Hollywood	9	26	The small-town experience soon humbles Ben when he misdiagnoses a young boy as having mitral valve regurgitation leading to late cyanosis, a case the town's curmudgeonly doctor, Aurelius Hogue, treats with a Coca-Cola.
Doc Hollywood	10	26	Hogue explains that the boy had chewed his father's tobacco and was given too much bismuth subnitrate as an antacid, causing a blue tinge; the carbonic acid component of the soda would relieve his stomachache.
Doc Hollywood	11	26	The two finally bond when Ben saves Hogue after he suffers a near-fatal heart attack.
Doc Hollywood	12	26	Since Hogue is eager to retire, Ben is urged by the locals to stay and replace him, although he is tempted by his budding romance with a tomboyish ambulance driver, Vialula, better known as "Lou," a single mother to a four-year-old named Emma.
Doc Hollywood	13	26	Ben soon confides to her that he grew up in a small town in rural Indiana, where his parents lived and died, and how he can't see himself confined to a small town.
Doc Hollywood	14	26	Lou is also pursued by Hank Gordon, a local insurance salesman.
Doc Hollywood	15	26	He waits for Ben at the mayor's lakeside lodge, where Ben has been staying.
Doc Hollywood	16	26	Ben expects a fight, but Hank explains that though he can't give Lou what Ben can, he's still a better man for her.
Doc Hollywood	17	26	After the two men talk, Ben comes to realize he's not selfless enough for a life with Lou and plans to not see her anymore.
Doc Hollywood	18	26	Ben is soon pardoned from community service for saving Hogue, allowing him to head to California for his job interview.
Doc Hollywood	19	26	With his car fixed, he tries to sneak out of town, but his departure is delayed when he finds Kyle and Mary Owens stranded by the side of the road with Mary in deep labor.
Doc Hollywood	20	26	While he's delivering their baby, a tractor trailer smashes into his Porsche and he must leave town without it: the entire town comes to see him off in a taxi.
Doc Hollywood	21	26	On the West Coast, Ben's new boss, dr Halberstrom, hires him at the interview, based on an unexpected recommendation from Hogue.
Doc Hollywood	22	26	However, Ben soon tires of the superficiality of Beverly Hills, even going so far as calling to check the weather in Grady on his phone.

The Baxter	0	46	Eliot is a dependable and reliable‚Äîthough thoroughly average‚Äîyoung man with a streak of bad luck, terminally typecast as a nice guy in a life that mimics the clich√©s of typical romantic comedies.
The Baxter	1	46	In high school he was stood up by his date on Prom night when her ex-boyfriend, the most popular kid in school, swept her off her feet while Eliot was getting drinks.
The Baxter	2	46	In college, his next serious girlfriend's ex-boyfriend wooed her during a pep rally by announcing that he would abandon Lacrosse in favor of attending her audition to Juilliard.
The Baxter	3	46	During business school, he and his then-girlfriend are intercepted by one of her ex-boyfriends with a puppy.
The Baxter	4	46	Losing three girlfriends to their ex-boyfriends has made Eliot defensive at the proposition of being abandoned (yet again) and having his heart broken.
The Baxter	5	46	About a week before his wedding to his girlfriend, Caroline Swann, he discovers that she had a long-lost love in high school, Bradley, from whom she was inseparable.
The Baxter	6	46	Eliot tries to keep himself composed, but even Caroline's reassurances do not convince him that her feelings for Bradley are buried.
The Baxter	7	46	Though he makes a last-ditch effort to convince her to elope, she refuses, and Eliot starts bracing himself for the worst when Bradley drops by and begins trying to win Caroline's affections again.
The Baxter	8	46	In frustration, Eliot has a chance encounter with an office temp, Cecil (Michelle Williams), who shares the same elevator with him while he blurts out his unfortunate past.
The Baxter	9	46	As he resigns himself to losing Caroline to Bradley, Cecil offers him a ray of hope: she does not believe in "Baxters" and thinks that his predicament is avoidable.
The Baxter	10	46	The two meet up again later that night at a small club where Cecil likes to perform her original songs to finish their conversation, and Cecil states her theory: Eliot needs to take more risks.
The Baxter	11	46	His problems began in High School when he didn't ask his first girlfriend to dance because she was on crutches, and this provided the opportunity for her ex-boyfriend to reignite her passion.
The Baxter	12	46	Eliot decides to take more risks, though he is unsure on when and how to do so due to his reserved habits.
The Baxter	13	46	When Cecil has a fight with her boyfriend later that night, Eliot offers to put her up for the night.
The Baxter	14	46	The next morning, Caroline and their wedding planner (Peter Dinklage), show up early to finalize their plans.
The Baxter	15	46	Cecil wakes up Eliot, and he rushes to get ready in time for their arrival, and even though the night before had been completely innocent, he panics while getting ready and accidentally puts on Cecil's underwear instead of his own.
The Baxter	16	46	After an accidental spill, the wedding planner spots the panties on Eliot, which completely breaks down Eliot's calm.
The Baxter	17	46	During the meeting, Eliot makes a string of awkward suggestions, ranging from asking for a "funk" music theme and "baja cuisine" for their dinner plans.
The Baxter	18	46	Caroline, visibly upset, begins to doubt their relationship and almost runs into the hiding Cecil a few times, though Eliot manages to cover.
The Baxter	19	46	After the meeting with the wedding planner, Caroline calls off the wedding.
The Baxter	20	46	Eliot, having been stood up for a dinner with his parents, goes out to a bar with his friends from work where he accidentally runs into Cecil's boyfriend, Dan (Paul Rudd), and Bradley with his current girlfriend.
The Baxter	21	46	Though awkward at first, Dan dismisses any conflict when he realizes that Eliot is "the Baxter" that Cecil mentioned and actually thanks him for letting her stay at his house when they fought.
The Baxter	22	46	Dan and Bradley (now revealed that Bradley's girlfriend is an old friend of Dan) insist that the groups spend some time together and chat, much to Eliot's chagrin.
The Baxter	23	46	Both Dan and Bradley laugh and joke with Eliot's friends, until one of them mentions that Caroline left him.
The Baxter	24	46	Depressed and upset, Eliot leaves and contemplates suicide until he is interrupted by his friend, Louis (David Wain), who gives him a pep talk on behalf of Caroline, who was worried about him.
The Baxter	25	46	On Louis' advice, he buys flowers, candies, and plans to take Caroline wherever it will take to make things right.
The Baxter	26	46	When he arrives, he finds Bradley already at Caroline's apartment, swooning over Caroline and upset about breaking up with his girlfriend.
The Baxter	27	46	They cancel his reservations to an expensive restaurant and go instead to a burger place that Bradley knows well.
The Baxter	28	46	Eliot feels awkward because of Bradley's personal connections to the owner and patrons, while Eliot's refined tastes clash with the blue-collar atmosphere.
The Baxter	29	46	Even with the owner's help, Eliot continues to feel out-of-place and eventually calls Cecil from the back of the restaurant, confessing that he feels that his marriage will be over before it begins.
The Baxter	30	46	The next day, Eliot arrives at work to find that Cecil is his temp again due to a flu going around the office.
The Baxter	31	46	When she proposes that they both go out and have a drink to celebrate their mutual misery, Eliot explains that after his phone call, the night actually got better for him.
The Baxter	32	46	After their somewhat disastrous dinner, Bradley and Caroline demanded to go dancing and accused Eliot of being neither spontaneous nor romantic; he stands up for himself and defends his actions and firmly states that he is trying his best to change for her.
The Baxter	33	46	At the end of his speech, he also reveals that he has changed his mind and now wants to go dancing with them, having convinced himself to try even harder to change for her‚Äîand reminding himself that his problems began when he didn't ask his first girlfriend to dance when he had the chance.
The Baxter	34	46	Though embarrassed, the throws caution to the wind and accepts a lighthearted dance-off against Bradley, a former break-dancer.
The Baxter	35	46	By accident, Bradley's final move, a spinning windmill, bumps Eliot in the face, both knocking him to the floor and bloodying his nose.
The Baxter	36	46	Bradley apologizes and reveals, to everyone's surprise, that he will leave the next day with his science team.
The Baxter	37	46	Though happy for him, Cecil is saddened by the news because, like Eliot, she has always seen herself as a "Baxter" and hoped that the two could commiserate together.
The Baxter	38	46	When Eliot asks what she'll do next, she mentions that Dan has a new job in Cincinnati, and she'll probably follow him there to resume her singing there.
The Baxter	39	46	At Caroline and Eliot's wedding, Bradley crashes the ceremony and declares his love for Caroline‚Äîa split second after Eliot has started his own objection‚Äîand Bradley and Caroline live happily ever after, according to Eliot.
The Baxter	40	46	He takes off immediately to catch Cecil before she leaves town, and after a near-miss, finds her at her apartment.
The Baxter	41	46	The two talk for a moment and Eliot declares his love, when the sudden appearance of one of Cecil's old boyfriends interrupts them.
The Baxter	42	46	Eliot, refusing to let history repeat itself, simply chases him off rather than let him get started with another speech.
The Baxter	43	46	The film closes with the pair performing in the same club where they had their first date, with Cecil singing one of her songs and Eliot playing the piano to back her up.
The Baxter	44	46	In a mid-credits scene, the film returns to Eliot catching Cecil about to leave with Dan for Cincinnati.
The Baxter	45	46	Narration begins, mirroring the narration done by Eliot in the beginning of the film, with Dan revealing himself to be a Baxter as well, describing his lament at losing the girl (Cecil) to the leading man (Eliot).

The Holiday	52	60	That, and the music that Miles wrote especially for Arthur for this moment, give him the confidence to walk onto the stage unassisted.

The Flame of New Orleans	5	51	Trying to catch the unsuspecting banker's attention she fakes fainting in her seat.
The Flame of New Orleans	6	51	The banker immediately rushes to her rescue and Claire's mission is accomplished.
The Flame of New Orleans	7	51	Desperate to the beautiful Claire again, Charles sends his valet over to Claire's maid Clementine after the opera.
The Flame of New Orleans	8	51	The maid forwards the message, asking Claire to meet with Charles in the park.
The Flame of New Orleans	9	51	Claire and the maid make a plan to let a man harass Claire in the park, so that Charles can come to her "rescue".
The Flame of New Orleans	10	51	But even the simplest plans go wrong, and on the way to the park Claire's carriage runs over a monkey by accident.
The Flame of New Orleans	11	51	The monkey belongs to river boat captain Robert Latour.
The Flame of New Orleans	12	51	he stops the carriage, but since Clementine believes this is the man they hired to make a fuzz with them, she tells the driver to go on and ignore the man.
The Flame of New Orleans	13	51	Robert Latour is aggravated by this behaviour and tips the carriage over.
The Flame of New Orleans	14	51	After this incident, where Charles was not only stood up by Claire since the carriage never arrived, but also deprived of a chance to come to her aid, he swears to avenge Robert Latour's insolent behaviour.

The Flame of New Orleans	16	51	Attending a Mardi Gras festivity, Claire recognizes Robert Latour in the crowd, and points him out to Charles, who is quick to challenge Robert to a duel.

Summer Magic	2	39	Upon the sale of the family's treasured piano ("Flitterin'"), Nancy reveals that the house is vacant and the family decides to relocate to the country ("Beautiful Beulah").
Summer Magic	3	39	When the Careys arrive in Beulah they realize they're slightly out-of-place although the town welcomes them.
Summer Magic	4	39	Overall, the Careys find that moving to the country was the best decision for them and they're content in their new home ("Summer Magic").
Summer Magic	5	39	But the house is in a shameful state of neglect, and caretaker Osh Popham (Burl Ives), against his wife's wishes, offers cheap labor to make the house livable, as well as offering free products from his hardware store.
Summer Magic	6	39	He also steers young Peter in the right direction, trading him a pair of overalls for his "Buster Brown suit" in which he now feels too citified, and offering him haircut money and carpentry lessons.
Summer Magic	7	39	But just when the Careys are settled in and things are going better, they find out that orphaned Cousin Julia's adoptive parents have run into their own financial problems and want to send her to the Careys.
Summer Magic	8	39	They reluctantly agree, and while they get ready for her, Gilly (Eddie Hodges) and Nancy entertain Peter (Jimmy Mathers) with jokes about her appearance and snobby, snotty personality ("Pink of Perfection").
Summer Magic	9	39	When Julia (Deborah Walley) arrives, she's even worse than her cousins remembered.
Summer Magic	10	39	Part of her welcome seems to include being jumped on by Peter's large dog Sam in the middle of the night.
Summer Magic	11	39	Aghast at Beulah's primitive ways, she forces Osh's daughter Lally Joy (Wendy Turner) to help her bathe in the kitchen rather than lug kettles of hot water up the stairs.
Summer Magic	12	39	While Nancy and Lally Joy cope with Julia, Peter enjoys working on the house with Osh, who entertains him with stories of bugs the like of which Peter hadn't dealt with in the city ("Ugly Bug Ball").

Summer Magic	14	39	He pretends that mr Hamilton has answered in the affirmative, only requesting that on Halloween the Careys must have a ceremony for his dead mother and find a decent place for her picture.
Summer Magic	15	39	The Careys accept and Osh chooses a fake picture for the ceremony.
Summer Magic	16	39	But Osh's wife Mariah, who has been on to his lies from the beginning, visits the yellow house to tell the Careys that mr Hamilton has no idea that they are there.

Summer Magic	20	39	Julia wins, leaving Nancy too jealous to enjoy the quiet evening after the party ("On the Front Porch").
Summer Magic	21	39	In their bedroom, her jealousy and anger drive her to reveal that Julia's adoptive parents "dumped" her on the Careys after gambling away their money.
Summer Magic	22	39	Julia flees to Aunt Margaret for assurance that her parents truly loved her, and Margaret reveals that her parents' situation is looking good enough that they are about ready for her to come home.
Summer Magic	23	39	This makes Nancy realize that she has grown to love Julia despite her many flaws (and her having "won" Charles), and she begs her to stay.
Summer Magic	24	39	Julia accepts, and prepares to move in permanently with the Careys.
Summer Magic	25	39	As Halloween approaches, everyone gets ready for the big party.
Summer Magic	26	39	Lally Joy, who harbors a big crush on Gilly, displays her ugly dress to Nancy and Julia, fretting embarrassment at the party.
Summer Magic	27	39	Nancy and Julia promise to redesign the dress as they give her pointers on how to act around boys ("Femininity").
Summer Magic	28	39	On the day of the party, a handsome young man (Peter Brown) appears at the yellow house and meets Nancy.
Summer Magic	29	39	She informs him that they'd been living in the house and tells him about the party for mr Hamilton's mother.
Summer Magic	30	39	The stranger quickly heads for Osh's store, where it is revealed that he is Tom Hamilton.
Summer Magic	31	39	Osh comes clean about renting the house to the Careys, inspired by Nancy's good-heartedness.
Summer Magic	32	39	Indignant, Tom leaves the store.
Summer Magic	33	39	Reluctant to escort Lally Joy to the party, Gilly becomes more willing as she makes her appearance in her beautiful redesigned dress.
Summer Magic	34	39	Seeing them together and Charles and Julia together, Nancy realizes that she's the only one without a partner; after talking it over with her mother, she decides to attend on her own.
Summer Magic	35	39	As she descends the stairs she runs into Tom Hamilton, who accompanies her to the party.
Summer Magic	36	39	Nancy presents the picture Osh had produced: unfortunately, it is a frighteningly ugly woman and Tom feels insulted and angry at Osh.
Summer Magic	37	39	He reveals his true identity to the thoroughly-embarrassed Nancy, and as he has taken a fancy to her, he asks her to dance.
Summer Magic	38	39	As the party gets going, Osh exclaims that things always work out in the end.

It Happened in Brooklyn	7	14	The story ends with Danny realizing the nurse he talked to at the start of the film is the only girl for him, and since he figures she's got to be back in Brooklyn herself, and he's got all kinds of friends now, he's optimistic about finding and winning her.

Gidget Goes Hawaiian	40	69	She implies to her mother that Gidget has slept with Eddie and other guys, rationalizing that it is half-true because Gidget had said that she gave herself "completely to that Moondoggie person".

Girl Shy	18	31	Heartbroken, Mary impulsively agrees to marry Ronald.
Girl Shy	19	31	Afterward, though, one of mr Thornby's senior employees convinces him that, if the staff liked the book so much, there must be a market for it, so Thornby decides to publish it as "The Boob's Diary".

Girl Shy	21	31	Fortunately, his uncle notices that one of the scraps is part of an advance royalty check for $3,000; the accompanying letter states that the book will be published as a comedy.

Girl Shy	26	31	Harold embarks on a frenzied headlong dash, involving bootleggers, car chases and multiple changes of vehicle (from missing the train to various cars to a trolley to a police motorcycle to a horse-drawn wagon to horseback), through the countryside and along the crowded streets of Culver City and Los Angeles.

Stay Hungry	0	40	Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) is a young Southern man born of a wealthy family, but left lonely and idle after his parents died in a plane crash.
Stay Hungry	1	40	He is content to spend his time fishing, hunting and puttering around his large family mansion, inhabited only by himself and a butler (Scatman Crothers).
Stay Hungry	2	40	Blake's "job" is a sinecure working at a shady investment firm run by a slick con artist named Jabo (Joe Spinell) and he does very little actual work.
Stay Hungry	3	40	But since he has to have his name "on paper" somehow as an employee, he is asked to personally transact the purchasing of a small gym that the real estate firm is buying in order to clear space for an office high-rise.
Stay Hungry	4	40	He initially approaches the gym representing himself as a businessman looking to buy it, and acts relatively impersonal with its staff, although he is strangely fascinated with the world he discovers there (reflecting the expansion of physical exercise to the mainstream which occurred in the 1970s).
Stay Hungry	5	40	But Blake's primary social life is centered around the upscale country club he attends.
Stay Hungry	6	40	The audience is introduced to the ritzy country club crowd, including the WASP-y Lester (Ed Begley, Jr) and the roguish rake Halsey (John David Carson).
Stay Hungry	7	40	Blake spends his time at this club with his friends playing tennis and shooting poker dice, and flirting with the upper-class women of all ages - one of whom asks Blake to find an "authentic" musical guest for an upcoming party at the club.
Stay Hungry	8	40	As Blake moves forward with his business deal, he falls in love with the gym after visiting it several times - he is immediately taken by the pretty receptionist Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) and the free-spirited, friendly bodybuilder Joe Santo (Schwarzenegger), who aspires to win the mr Universe title.
Stay Hungry	9	40	He cannot bring himself to sell out his newfound friends at the gym for the sake of his job, and so he evades the inquiries of his friend and coworker Hal Foss as to his progress in the purchasing deal.
Stay Hungry	10	40	All the while, he grows closer to Mary Tate and Joe Santo - who initially appear to be a couple.
Stay Hungry	11	40	However, Mary Tate latches onto Craig romantically - and Santo gives Craig his blessing for this unorthodox relationship, claiming that he needs to keep himself challenged both in the gym and in his romantic life in order to succeed.
Stay Hungry	12	40	Mary Tate and Craig begin a passionate and exciting relationship.
Stay Hungry	13	40	But trouble erupts when he tries to integrate Mary Tate into his country-club scene.
Stay Hungry	14	40	This tension comes to a head at a party at the country club, which features Joe Santo as a musical guest, performing bluegrass songs on the violin with a small country group.
Stay Hungry	15	40	Craig, with Mary Tate as his guest (dressed inappropriately in a garish and revealing pink dress), is enthusiastic about Joe Santo's upcoming musical performance for the night.
Stay Hungry	16	40	But Craig's friends, particularly Halsey, mock Santo as a "freak" and an outcast.
Stay Hungry	17	40	When Halsey suggest that Santo disrobe and show the crowd his "tits," Craig throws a glass of Scotch in his face and tells Halsey that Santo could "crush him like an eggshell".
Stay Hungry	18	40	A fight nearly breaks out between the two, but is broken up.
Stay Hungry	19	40	Meanwhile, a bitter Halsey and his friend Packman formulate a plan to embarrass Santo.
Stay Hungry	20	40	When Santo's musical act is finally put on stage, the crowd seems enthusiastic about the music, though the hostess of the party dismisses it as a "racket".
Stay Hungry	21	40	However, Halsey and Packman drunkenly bellow at Santo and heckle the band.
Stay Hungry	22	40	Santo notices it, but stoically continues playing.
Stay Hungry	23	40	However, when Halsey screams "let's hear it for Muscle Beach symphony orchestra.
Stay Hungry	24	40	" Santo is unable to continue playing, puts down his violin and leaves the party.
Stay Hungry	25	40	Meanwhile, a frustrated Craig tries to convince Mary Tate to see him for who he really is, and not for his snobbish friends and ritzy surroundings.
Stay Hungry	26	40	The mr Universe contest is approaching fast and Santo is training hard.
Stay Hungry	27	40	But Jabo, owner of the shady real estate firm, attempts to bribe the owner of the gym, Thor Eriksen, when he realizes that Blake will not purchase the building as he was supposed to.
Stay Hungry	28	40	He plies Eriksen and his assistant Newton with drugs, booze and hookers, and on the day of the contest, they are busy with acts of debauchery as Santo is readying to take the stage - hoping to beat his rival Dougie Stewart (fellow bodybuilder Ken Waller in a memorable cameo).
Stay Hungry	29	40	While Thor is drunk and distracted with the prostitutes, Newton secretly stashes the prize money inside his handbag, and then leaves the gym with the prostitutes when they are finished - stealing the money and fleeing.
Stay Hungry	30	40	Meanwhile, Joe Santo and Dougie Stewart pose together on stage, to the theme song from the film 'Exodus' and the enthusiastic applause of the crowd.
Stay Hungry	31	40	Meanwhile, Blake visits at the gym and engages in an intense physical fight, dodging weights and gym equipment thrown by the drunken and drug-crazed Eriksen.
Stay Hungry	32	40	He finds Mary Tate at the gym, who had just moments earlier been assaulted by Eriksen in an amyl nitrite fueled rage.
Stay Hungry	33	40	When the contestants at the mr Universe show discover that the prize money has been stolen, they run after Joe Santo, who himself is actually running to try to meet Mary Tate.
Stay Hungry	34	40	The chase results in the wave of bodybuilders pouring out into the streets of Birmingham, to the amazed crowd of onlookers which sees them.
Stay Hungry	35	40	The bodybuilders take advantage of this unexpected attention to put on an impromptu posing routine for the crowd, and the members of the crowd join in, imitating the athletes' poses and enjoying themselves - an embracing of the bodybuilding lifestyle by 'normal' people which arguably represents the real-life 1970s boom of personal fitness.
Stay Hungry	36	40	The film ends with Craig sarcastically deriding his former bosses at the real-estate firm, and deciding to go into the gym business with Joe Santo.
Stay Hungry	37	40	A voice-over by his uncle Albert says, "you may not have been the Blake that we anticipated, but you are definitely Craig Blake - an identity that no one will dare challenge".
Stay Hungry	38	40	Craig has finally "found himself" and discovered a true place in the sun, and true friendships, and he mocks his former boss Jabo with an exaggerated bodybuilding pose - acting as a final burning of the bridge between his old life and his new one.
Stay Hungry	39	40	The final shot of the film shows Craig moving out of his family's mansion, passing on all of his old family memorabilia to his loyal butler, and leaving behind his old self once and for all - on the way to a new and exciting future.

101 Reykjav√≠k	0	51	Geek Hlynur is approaching 30 years old, still lives with his mother who is divorced from his alcoholic father, downloads porn and wanders around Reykjav√≠k half-heartedly searching for a job while spending lots of time in Kaffibarinn, the central Reykjav√≠k bar (the bar is owned in real life by writer/director Baltasar Korm√°kur and his soundtrack composer Damon Albarn, a long-standing Icelandophile).
101 Reykjav√≠k	1	51	The cramped, dark and oddly furnished house in which Hlynur and his mother live features a bath which transfigures into a sofa as Hlynur steps naked out of it, in the middle of the lounge with his mother watching.
101 Reykjav√≠k	2	51	Hlynur's isolated world ‚Äî no small metaphor for his home country ‚Äî is going along rather blissfully ignorant of the greater joys involved with engaging in life until his mother's friend Lola Milagros arrives to stay at the house for a while.
101 Reykjav√≠k	3	51	Lola is a Spanish flamenco instructor with a seductive smile, a sultry voice and a carpe-diem attitude.
101 Reykjav√≠k	4	51	Unknown to Hlynur, she is also in love with his mother, Berglind.
101 Reykjav√≠k	5	51	An enigmatic character, Lola quickly becomes the center of the household dynamic when, after a night of heavy drinking while mom is away, she and Hlynur sleep together.
101 Reykjav√≠k	6	51	The fling remains a secret between Hlynur and Lola.
101 Reykjav√≠k	7	51	(Throughout the film, the song Lola often plays as background music) As Hlynur gradually learns of their lesbian relationship, he becomes jealous of it, realizing that he was simply a momentary fling for Lola, but he is also the dutiful son who wants to accept his mother's newfound lesbianism and be happy for her.
101 Reykjav√≠k	8	51	He also has occasional oedipal / incestuous dreams about his mother.
101 Reykjav√≠k	9	51	Lola wants Hlynur to get out of the house and find himself something to do because she recognizes from the start that that's what he needs most, but Hlynur prefers to pass the time in a true slacker fashion with plenty of excess and not an iota of effort.
101 Reykjav√≠k	10	51	He sees no real future for himself, rather an entire life supported by the Icelandic welfare state.
101 Reykjav√≠k	11	51	"It's a great system".
101 Reykjav√≠k	12	51	he says.
101 Reykjav√≠k	13	51	When asked what he does, Hlynur responds with, "Nothing".
101 Reykjav√≠k	14	51	Pushed further with, "What kind of nothing.
101 Reykjav√≠k	15	51	" he replies the only way he can: "A nothing kind of nothing".
101 Reykjav√≠k	16	51	Not even death is a serious topic for Hlynur ‚Äî intoxicating, out-all-night weekends inspire, "Each weekend I drop dead".
101 Reykjav√≠k	17	51	He says this while lighting up a Lucky atop a snow-capped mountain, where he lies down as the snow gradually covers him up, but his plans are scuppered by rainfall melting his would-be tomb.
101 Reykjav√≠k	18	51	His mixed up thoughts include musings about suicide: "The worst thing about AIDS as a method of suicide is that it takes so long to die from it".
101 Reykjav√≠k	19	51	On the other hand, Hlynur's fantasy life is alive with passion and glimpses of his subconscious show us a deeply conflicted sense of self.
101 Reykjav√≠k	20	51	Flashbacks of an alcoholic father mix with sexual fantasies of the lovely Lola but quickly reveal that mom's in bed, too.
101 Reykjav√≠k	21	51	During a quick trip to the suburbs for a dinner with extended family, Hlynur, so comically disturbed by the mundane family ritual (they actually gather to watch a video of last year's family dinner), imagines a bloodbath scene killing everyone at close range with a shotgun.
101 Reykjav√≠k	22	51	When brought back to reality, Hlynur's blank slate and effortless personality come back into the fore: "I was thinking what a nice couch you have", he explains to the previously slaughtered family.
101 Reykjav√≠k	23	51	Hlynur's confusion over the whole situation is expressed in his rather profound and imaginative musings:   There they are.
101 Reykjav√≠k	24	51	my mother the lesbian, and my father the boozer.
101 Reykjav√≠k	25	51	What am I then.
101 Reykjav√≠k	26	51	The offspring of a lesbian and a boozer.
101 Reykjav√≠k	27	51	It's like two birds of different species.
101 Reykjav√≠k	28	51	The lesbian bird and the boozer bird.
101 Reykjav√≠k	29	51	The boozer is a wetland bird.
101 Reykjav√≠k	30	51	He's rather heavy.
101 Reykjav√≠k	31	51	and needs a good run-up to get off the ground.
101 Reykjav√≠k	32	51	He can fly for a long time and has good stamina.
101 Reykjav√≠k	33	51	Several weeks may pass by before he gets back on the ground.
101 Reykjav√≠k	34	51	In between he lies low and goes on the defensive.
101 Reykjav√≠k	35	51	Especially for the first days after landing.
101 Reykjav√≠k	36	51	The lesbian.
101 Reykjav√≠k	37	51	Unlike the boozer.
101 Reykjav√≠k	38	51	the lesbian is a relative newcomer to Icelandic nature.
101 Reykjav√≠k	39	51	She is thought to have migrated from Denmark and Britain.
101 Reykjav√≠k	40	51	Her only contact with the male bird is during conception.
101 Reykjav√≠k	41	51	In recent years we have witnessed cases of male birds.
101 Reykjav√≠k	42	51	who are unable to fly at all.
101 Reykjav√≠k	43	51	The offspring of a boozer and a lesbian is the Hlynur.
101 Reykjav√≠k	44	51	an unusually slow developer that can't fly.
101 Reykjav√≠k	45	51	and remains with his mother for the first 30 years.
101 Reykjav√≠k	46	51	The Hlynur is defensive by nature, but harmless.

The Princess Bride	2	56	Westley's response to her demands is always "As you wish".
The Princess Bride	3	56	She eventually realizes that what he is really saying is, "I love you".
The Princess Bride	4	56	After Buttercup realizes, as well, that she truly and strongly loves him and confesses her mutually strong romantic feelings, Westley leaves to seek his fortune, so they can marry.
The Princess Bride	5	56	Buttercup later receives word that the Dread Pirate Roberts, who is notorious for killing all those whose vessels he boards, attacked his ship at sea.
The Princess Bride	6	56	Believing Westley dead, Buttercup sinks into abject despair, declaring, "I will never love again".
The Princess Bride	7	56	Some time later, she reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin, due to a law allowing the prince to choose any unmarried woman as his bride, though she makes it clear that she does not love him.
The Princess Bride	8	56	Before the wedding, a trio of outlaws‚Äîthe Sicilian criminal genius Vizzini, the Spanish fencing master Inigo Montoya, and the enormous and mighty Turkish wrestler Fezzik‚Äîkidnap Buttercup.
The Princess Bride	9	56	A masked man in black follows them across the sea and up the Cliffs of Insanity, whereupon Vizzini orders Inigo to stop him.

The Princess Bride	16	56	The man in black accepts the challenge and chokes Fezzik until the giant blacks out.
The Princess Bride	17	56	He then catches up with Vizzini and proposes a battle of wits, guessing which cup of wine is poisoned with iocaine powder.
The Princess Bride	18	56	They drink, and the man in black reveals that both cups were poisoned, but he had previously cultivated an immunity to iocaine powder.
The Princess Bride	19	56	Vizzini dies.
The Princess Bride	20	56	With Prince Humperdinck's rescue party in hot pursuit, the man in black flees with Buttercup.
The Princess Bride	21	56	He taunts Buttercup, claiming that women cannot be trusted and that she must have felt nothing when her true love and sweetheart had died.
The Princess Bride	22	56	Enraged, she shoves him into a gorge, yelling, "You can die, too, for all I care.
The Princess Bride	23	56	", only to hear him call, "As you wish.
The Princess Bride	24	56	" from the bottom of the ravine.
The Princess Bride	25	56	She realizes he is none other than her dearly beloved Westley, and follows him down into the gorge, to find him battered but largely unhurt.
The Princess Bride	26	56	While traveling through the Fire Swamp to evade Humperdinck's party, Westley tells Buttercup that the Dread Pirate Roberts did attack his ship, but kept him alive after he explained the depths of his love for her.
The Princess Bride	27	56	Westley became the Dread Pirate Roberts' valet, and later his friend.
The Princess Bride	28	56	Over the course of four years, Westley learned how to fence, fight, and sail.

The Princess Bride	30	56	After facing many trying ordeals such as Snow Sand and Rodents of Unusual Size, Westley and Buttercup successfully navigate the Fire Swamp, whereupon they are captured by Prince Humperdinck and his cruel six-fingered assistant, Count Tyrone Rugen.
The Princess Bride	31	56	Buttercup negotiates for Westley's release and returns with Humperdinck to the palace to await their wedding.
The Princess Bride	32	56	Rugen follows Humperdinck's secret instructions to not release Westley, but to take him to the fifth level of his underground hunting arena, the "Zoo of Death".
The Princess Bride	33	56	Here, Rugen gravely tortures and weakens Westley with his horribly painful life-sucking invention, The Machine, to obtain first-hand information for completing his definitive book on pain along with appeasing Humperdinck's annoyance that Buttercup does and always will prefer Westley to him.
The Princess Bride	34	56	Meanwhile, Buttercup has several nightmares regarding her marriage to the prince.
The Princess Bride	35	56	She expresses her unhappiness to Humperdinck, who proposes a deal wherein he will send out four ships to locate Westley, but if they fail to find him, Buttercup will marry him.
The Princess Bride	36	56	The novel reveals that, to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder, Humperdinck himself had arranged Buttercup's kidnapping and murder, but that he now believes that Buttercup dying on her wedding night will inspire his subjects to war even more effectively.

The Princess Bride	38	56	Knowing that Vizzini is dead, they seek out the man in black hoping that, if he could outsmart Vizzini, his wits will help them plan a successful attack on the castle to find and kill Count Rugen.
The Princess Bride	39	56	Buttercup learns that Humperdinck never sent any ships, and taunts him with her enduring love for Westley.
The Princess Bride	40	56	Enraged, Humperdinck tortures Westley to death via The Machine at its maximum setting.
The Princess Bride	41	56	Westley's death screams echo across the land, drawing Inigo and Fezzik to the Zoo of Death and down through its many dangerous levels.
The Princess Bride	42	56	Finding Westley's body, they enlist the help of the King of Florin's former "miracle man", a magician named Miracle Max who was fired by Humperdinck.
The Princess Bride	43	56	Max pronounces Westley to be merely "mostly dead", and returns him to life (out of a desire to get back at Humperdinck), though Westley remains partially paralyzed and weak.
The Princess Bride	44	56	Westley devises a successful plan to invade the castle during the wedding, and the commotion caused by this prompts Humperdinck to cut the wedding short.
The Princess Bride	45	56	Buttercup decides to commit suicide when she reaches the honeymoon suite.

The Princess Bride	47	56	My name is Inigo Montoya.
The Princess Bride	48	56	You killed my father.
The Princess Bride	49	56	Prepare to die".
The Princess Bride	50	56	) throughout the duel, kills him in a sword fight.
The Princess Bride	51	56	Westley reaches Buttercup before she commits suicide.
The Princess Bride	52	56	Still partially paralyzed, he bluffs his way out of a sword fight with Humperdinck, who shows himself to be a coward.
The Princess Bride	53	56	Instead of killing his rival, Westley decides to leave him alive for a long, miserable life with his obvious cowardice as his only companion.
The Princess Bride	54	56	The party then rides off into the sunset on four of the prince's purebred white horses which Fezzik had conveniently discovered.

A Good Year	1	29	Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical yet very successful hard-working London-based bond trader with a sense of humour.
A Good Year	2	29	Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole beneficiary of the French property.
A Good Year	3	29	He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale.
A Good Year	4	29	Shortly after arriving he almost knocks a local caf√© owner, Fanny Chenal, off her bicycle as a result of his careless driving.
A Good Year	5	29	Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and the CEO orders him to return to London as soon as possible.
A Good Year	6	29	To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool.
A Good Year	7	29	He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, driving by and spotting his rental car, appears and turns on the water supply in retaliation.
A Good Year	8	29	This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week.
A Good Year	9	29	On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines.
A Good Year	10	29	Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless.
A Good Year	11	29	In the meantime, they are surprised by the unexpected arrival of young Napa Valley oenophile Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter.
A Good Year	12	29	Like Max, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu ("the lost corner") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics.
A Good Year	13	29	Max is concerned that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her during dinner at the Duflot house.
A Good Year	14	29	Max gets updates on office politics from his assistant Gemma, who warns him of the ambitious antics of other employees.
A Good Year	15	29	To ensure he is not usurped by Kenny, his second-in-command in London, through whom Max continues to direct trades, Max intentionally gives the ambitious young trader bad advice, getting Kenny fired.
A Good Year	16	29	Max becomes enamoured with the beautiful, feisty caf√© owner Fanny, who is rumoured to have sworn off men.
A Good Year	17	29	He successfully woos Fanny into his bed, where she leaves him the next morning, expecting him to return to his life in London.
A Good Year	18	29	A disillusioned Christie also decides to move on.
A Good Year	19	29	Max finds his uncle's memoirs, which contain proof of Christie's heritage.
A Good Year	20	29	However, he bids her farewell while handing her an unexplained note inside a book she was reading.
A Good Year	21	29	While informing Duflot of the pending estate sale, Max learns that the mysterious expensive Le Coin Perdu was made by Henry and Duflot with "illegal vines" from the estate, bypassing wine classification and appellation laws.
A Good Year	22	29	The estate is sold and Max returns to London where Sir Nigel, the company chairman, offers him a choice: "Money or your life" - either a discharge settlement, which includes "a lot of zeros," or the partnership in the trading firm, where he would then be "made for life".
A Good Year	23	29	Max asks about Nigel's art in the conference room, which Fanny has a copy of in her restaurant.
A Good Year	24	29	Upon Nigel's dismissive comment that the real one is kept in a vault and the $200,000 copy in the office is for show, Max reconsiders if he wants to still be like Nigel.
A Good Year	25	29	Max invalidates the estate's sale with the farewell letter he gave to Christie, which he forged, along with real photos confirming Christie as Henry's daughter with a valid claim to the estate  (as a child Max signed cheques for his uncle, and is able to replicate his handwriting and signature).
A Good Year	26	29	He puts his London residence up for sale and returns to Provence, entering into a relationship with Fanny.
A Good Year	27	29	Christie also returns and she and Francis jointly run the vineyard while trying to reconcile their vastly different philosophies of wine production.

Two Much	7	40	Because of the heiress fortune the news immediately makes the tabloids.

Two Much	10	40	If Art is attracted to Liz, she stays very cold and distant, seeing him as nothing more than a gigolo who hit the jackpot.
Two Much	11	40	Art decides to invent a fake twin brother Bart (who wears glasses and has his hair down instead of wearing a ponytail) who is allegedly a painter who just got back from Italy.
Two Much	12	40	Bart and Liz instantly hit it off while Gene still tries to romance Betty.

Two Much	15	40	Thanks to his imaginary twin brother, Art manages to pursue a romance with both sisters.
Two Much	16	40	Because the two "twin brothers" must never be in the same place at the same time, it however involves a lot of running around, coming up with a lot of excuses and enlisting a very reluctant Gloria's help.
Two Much	17	40	One evening he needs to go out two separate dates with both Betty and Liz.
Two Much	18	40	At the restaurant with Betty, he decides to drug her wine, much to the horror of the sommelier (Vincent Schiavelli).

Two Much	27	40	After they leave, Liz arrives to the studio, thinking Bart got beat up.
Two Much	28	40	When Bart tells her he is Art, that he fell in love when he saw her in the shower and tries to kiss her, Liz thinks Art is trying to make a pass at her, not realizing Bart doesn't exist.

Two Much	30	40	Bart needs to "confront" Art in a study alone, with Liz and Gene listening outside -and, unbeknownst to anyone, also by Betty through the phone.
Two Much	31	40	When Gene enters the study, he confronts a lonely Art, and again threatens him if he doesn't marry Betty.
Two Much	32	40	He tells him that what Art or even himself want is irrelevant, and that the only thing that matters is Betty's happiness.
Two Much	33	40	During the wedding ceremony, Betty, shaken by Gene's selfless devotion, calls the wedding off and falls in Gene's arms acknowledging she still love him too.
Two Much	34	40	Gene and Betty elope.

Two Much	36	40	Bart then go see Liz, telling her a fake excuse to "go back to Italy" (which she of course doesn't buy), adding he's not worthy of her.
Two Much	37	40	A few month later, Art's gallery has experienced a dramatic turnaround (Gloria owns and manages it, and Art is the artist) and is now very successful.

Two Much	39	40	Art manages to convince her he is the one she had feelings for, and the movie ends with the two happily walking in the street, hand in hand.

Breezy	2	36	Breezy lost her parents years before in an auto accident, and has taken the lifestyle of a homeless free-spirited hippie in California.
Breezy	3	36	That same morning, Frank Harmon (William Holden) is bidding farewell to his overnight guest, a very beautiful blonde that openly shows interest in him.
Breezy	4	36	He is only humoring her as she leaves, and the audience gets the first sense of how detached he is emotionally.
Breezy	5	36	Middle-aged, divorced and wealthy from his work in real estate, Frank lacks for nothing material.
Breezy	6	36	His beautiful post-modern home is the setting for much of the movie.
Breezy	7	36	After escaping a bad hitchhiked ride with an unstable stranger, Breezy loiters near Frank‚Äôs home, and runs to him as he‚Äôs leaving for work.
Breezy	8	36	She invites herself into his car and happily insists that he give her a ride to her destination.

Breezy	28	36	These conflicts eventually break him, after a sobering discussion with Bob in a sauna.
Breezy	29	36	Bob reveals that there is no way he himself could embark on such a relationship, as he might feel like a ‚Äúchild molester‚Äù.

The Wedding Party	25	38	So he rehearses the apology (to Sybil, to Polly, to himself and to empty space) "I'm so sorry, I made a mistake", but by the time he reaches the guests' room, the sentence has become "I'm so sorry, but my wife has made a mistake.

The Heavenly Kid	2	21	He dies as his car plummets over the cliff into a fiery wreck.
The Heavenly Kid	3	21	Bobby awakens to find himself aboard a speeding train, which stops at a station housing a huge escalator going up into a bright white light, which one of the attendants refers to as "Uptown".

The Heavenly Kid	5	21	After many years in limbo Bobby is finally given his assignment: he is to return to Earth and act as a guardian angel and friend for Lenny Barnes (Jason Gedrick), a promising high school student who is constantly picked on in school, particularly by school bullies Fred Gallo (Stephen Gregory) and Bill McIntyre (Beau Dremann).
The Heavenly Kid	6	21	However, Bobby is instructed that he is only allowed to reveal himself to Lenny and nobody else.
The Heavenly Kid	7	21	Bobby helps Lenny by giving him a makeover, assisting him in dealing with Fred and Bill, and helping him win the affection of the hottest girl in school, Sharon (Anne Sawyer).

The Heavenly Kid	13	21	Much like Bobby's car race, the race ends with Lenny and Bobby flying over the edge of a cliff, and the car exploding in a fiery wreck.
The Heavenly Kid	14	21	However, Bobby prevents Lenny from dying, and they climb up the cliff together.
The Heavenly Kid	15	21	Bobby helps Lenny see the error of his ways as Lenny reunites with his long-time friend Melissa (Nancy Valen), who was in love with him and by his side even during his "nerdy years".
The Heavenly Kid	16	21	After bidding an emotional goodbye to Lenny, during which he tells him that they will always be best friends, Bobby offers himself to Rafferty to fulfill his end of the bargain by accepting a ride "Downtown" (essentially, to Hell).
The Heavenly Kid	17	21	However, Rafferty explains that this will not be happening.
The Heavenly Kid	18	21	Bobby incredulously asks why, since he had made a deal to trade his own soul for Lenny's second chance at life.
The Heavenly Kid	19	21	Rafferty explains to Bobby that he had learned to love and value someone more than himself, and that is how one earned a ticket Uptown.
The Heavenly Kid	20	21	Lenny and his girlfriend then watch Bobby and Rafferty fly into the sky on a motorbike, while the movie ends with Bobby going on the escalator to Uptown.

Jump In!	0	95	Seventeen-year-old Isadore "Izzy" Daniels (Corbin Bleu) is a star boxer in Brooklyn.
Jump In!	1	95	His father Kenneth (David Reivers), a golden glove champion and widower, coaches him and encourages him to do his best, while his sassy eight-year-old sister, Karin, is much more interested in Double Dutch.
Jump In!	2	95	Mary Thomas (Keke Palmer) is a teenage girl and competitive Double Dutch player, part of a team called the Joy Jumpers, who lives next door to Izzy; the two have a complicated relationship, always arguing when they see each other, but Mary's teammates and Karin know that they have crushes on each other.
Jump In!	3	95	Izzy's boxing skills are great enough that he stands only one exhibition match away from going to the Golden Gloves; his opponent is Rodney, the only other undefeated boxer in the gym.
Jump In!	4	95	Mary and the Joy Jumpers, meanwhile, are training for the regional championship, in order to make it on to the city finals.
Jump In!	5	95	On the day of the regional championship, Izzy is forced to take Karin and her friends to watch it when his father has to deal with a problem at the gym.
Jump In!	6	95	His two best friends Chuck and Earl, fellow boxers, tag along to try to convince him to join them for the movies, as they previously planned.
Jump In!	7	95	On their way, they meet Rodney, Izzy's competition and the neighborhood bully, who asserts that he'll destroy Izzy in the ring.
Jump In!	8	95	Arriving at the site of the regional competitions, Izzy witnesses as Mary and her teammates Shauna, Keisha, and a girl named Yolanda who moved to Brooklyn from Atlanta, deal with trash talk from the Dutch Dragons, the four-time regional champions.
Jump In!	9	95	The competition is divided into three stages: compulsory, speed, and freestyle.
Jump In!	10	95	Despite his best efforts to disguise it, it becomes clear that the more Izzy watches, the more he likes.
Jump In!	11	95	In the end, the Joy Jumpers take fourth place, barely qualifying for the city finals, and after dealing with snark from Gina, the leader of the Dutch Dragons, Yolanda criticizes Mary for her freestyle routine, blaming their poor performance on them.
Jump In!	12	95	Izzy and Karin leave as the team begins to argue.
Jump In!	13	95	Shortly before Izzy's match with Rodney, he witnesses him receiving a bag of clothes from one of the teachers; while he was the toughest guy on the street, he was just a poor kid dealing with problems at home.
Jump In!	14	95	Rodney angrily throws the bag away when he catches Izzy staring.
Jump In!	15	95	Later, the two meet up at the gym, and Rodney maintains his merciless attitude before and during the match.
Jump In!	16	95	He proves to be strong, but less skilled than Izzy.
Jump In!	17	95	Kenneth instructs him to watch his movements and find his rhythm.
Jump In!	18	95	Armed with this advice, Izzy gains the advantage, and ultimately wins.
Jump In!	19	95	Later that night, he retrieves the clothes and drops the bag at Rodney's door, fleeing before the latter sees him, but lingering at a safe distance to watch as he takes the clothes inside.
Jump In!	20	95	Meanwhile, Yolanda quits the Joy Jumpers, informing Mary that she cared most about winning.
Jump In!	21	95	In a complex way, Izzy helps to cheer her up after seeing her crying from her balcony.
Jump In!	22	95	The next day, Rodney confronts Izzy at the school, saying that he won due to a trick and demanding a rematch.
Jump In!	23	95	Izzy declines, but Rodney refuses to drop the subject.
Jump In!	24	95	Elsewhere, Mary, Shauna, and Keisha debate about who can replace Yolanda, bringing up several potential candidates, all with fatal flaws.
Jump In!	25	95	Izzy overhears them, and Shauna and Keisha explain that Yolanda joined the Dutch Dragons, leaving them down a player.
Jump In!	26	95	Izzy scoffs at the alleged difficulty of jumping rope, and Mary subsequently challenges Izzy to speed jump.
Jump In!	27	95	She demonstrates her own skills first, and then allows Izzy to try.
Jump In!	28	95	He gets a false start the first time, but upon his second attempt, he demonstrates as much skill as Mary, leaving the girls (and an unseen Karin, who watches from nearby) astonished.
Jump In!	29	95	Later, at the gym, Izzy is jumping rope as part of his training, and confides to Felix, the gym's wise head coach, that he was still upset about Rodney's attitude, and Felix replies that boxing doesn't solve those kinds of problems.
Jump In!	30	95	As he leaves, the Joy Jumpers enter the gym and ask Izzy to join their team, stating that they needed his skills, but he refuses because of what his friends might think.
Jump In!	31	95	Later, he meets Shauna and Keisha at a restaurant when he orders a pizza for dinner, and they present him a different offer: to serve as a stand-in, so that they can practice with a fourth player until they find someone to serve as a permanent replacement.
Jump In!	32	95	Izzy considers the offer, and after they coerce a reluctant Mary into asking him to agree, he does so, on the condition that they practice in the gym before school, where nobody can see them.
Jump In!	33	95	They begin the next morning, where Izzy learns that while compulsory and speed jumping are easy for him with his training, freestyle is more problematic for him.
Jump In!	34	95	He develops his skills quickly, however, and the next day, demonstrates enough skill to leave the three girls astonished once more.
Jump In!	35	95	Over the next several days, Izzy spends more and more time with the Joy Jumpers and improves tremendously at Double Dutch, though his boxing skills and punctuality suffer as a result.
Jump In!	36	95	Tammy, the only girl boxer in the gym and subsequently the object of much ridicule, confides to him after beating him in a match that she knows about his practicing, and promises to keep it a secret in exchange for ceasing the jokes about her, particularly around Chuck, whom she has a crush on (which is reciprocated).
Jump In!	37	95	One day, on his way to practice, Izzy spies some girls in the street jumping rope, which gives him inspiration for his team.
Jump In!	38	95	He explains to the Joy Jumpers, particularly Mary, that the freestyle routine needed to be redone due to being too boring; he tells them that freestyle should be based on fun, and brings up their childhoods when they enjoyed jumping rope and singing along with it.
Jump In!	39	95	He takes them to see the girls he saw, which gives them the inspiration to change up their team.
Jump In!	40	95	Walking back, they pass by Rodney, who is quick to belittle Izzy and begin to get violent.
Jump In!	41	95	Mary dumps a cooler of water on his head, and the four run away, Rodney giving up the chase quickly but angrily.
Jump In!	42	95	That night, Izzy and Mary talk on their balconies, Izzy admitting that he likes Double Dutch, but having difficulty due to his father's passion for boxing.
Jump In!	43	95	Mary confides that she once felt the same way about ballet, but eventually confessed to her mother that she hated it, and her mother easily accepted it.
Jump In!	44	95	Izzy states that it's not that easy with him, and Mary gives him a quick kiss before going back to her room.
Jump In!	45	95	Going back to his own, Izzy meets his father, who sternly confronts him about missing his curfew and a practice match that day.
Jump In!	46	95	Izzy promises not to be late again, and his dad leaves, leaving Izzy alone with his thoughts.
Jump In!	47	95	The following day, Rodney and his crony, Hooks, gang up on Izzy at school, but are quickly called off thanks to a passing teacher, who puts them in detention.
Jump In!	48	95	Later on, Rodney runs by the gym, and upon hearing the music inside, enters to see Izzy and the Joy Jumpers practicing.
Jump In!	49	95	Gleefully pondering his revenge, he and Hooks snap pictures of them and leave, unseen.
Jump In!	50	95	After practice, Mary brings up that they have yet to find a fourth player, and Izzy agrees to join the team permanently, on the condition that they change the name to Hot Chili Steppers.
Jump In!	51	95	They happily agree, and decide to enter a Double Dutch showcase that will be happening three days later.
Jump In!	52	95	When Izzy tries to leave for the event that day, however, his dad intercepts him, showing that he had bought tickets for the two of them to watch a boxing match.
Jump In!	53	95	Izzy is left with little choice but to agree to go, leaving his team to put on a disappointing performance, and leading Mary to expel him from the team, despite his apologies.
Jump In!	54	95	Shauna and Keisha try their hardest to convince Mary to reconsider her decision, but Mary remains obstinate.
Jump In!	55	95	Her grudge is soon forgotten, however, when Rodney publishes the pictures he took of Izzy and posts them on flyers all over the school, making Izzy a laughingstock.
Jump In!	56	95	She tries to talk to Izzy that night, but he ignores her, forcing her to give up.
Jump In!	57	95	His father goes to his room the following day to leave the prize he had received when he won the Golden Gloves, and finds a pair of Rodney's flyers in the trash can.
Jump In!	58	95	He immediately confronts Izzy about it, and Karin, despite her brother's objections, tells their father that he had joined Mary's team.
Jump In!	59	95	She is ordered to her room, and Kenneth asks Izzy why he didn't tell him.
Jump In!	60	95	Izzy angrily admits that his father was obsessed with boxing, that it was all that they talked about since his mother died, and that he no longer liked the sport, and only did it for him.
Jump In!	61	95	He finishes by saying that Kenneth had no right to take his life away because he no longer had one, visibly shaking him.
Jump In!	62	95	Izzy apologizes, and his father quietly accepts the apology before making an excuse to leave.
Jump In!	63	95	Izzy takes out his anger through training at the gym, where Mary finds him and asks him to rejoin the team.
Jump In!	64	95	Izzy coldly refuses, stating that he needs to focus on boxing, and rejects Mary even when she begs him.
Jump In!	65	95	She leaves, heartbroken and disappointed, and Tammy comes over to hold the punching bag Izzy is using.
Jump In!	66	95	She breaks through his anger by reminding him that she, as a female, had to endure a lot of trash talk from others, but didn't let it get her down, allowing her to become the best girl boxer in Brooklyn.
Jump In!	67	95	Felix encourages Izzy to listen to her advice.
Jump In!	68	95	That night, Rodney arrives at the gym as Izzy is leaving, bringing a large crowd with him.
Jump In!	69	95	He demands again that Izzy gives him the rematch he had requested, and after some mocking, Izzy agrees to it.
Jump In!	70	95	In the ring, Izzy keeps a cool head, responding to Rodney's mockery with fact, that he was angry because his father was out of work, and everyone thought of him as a loud-mouthed bully.
Jump In!	71	95	He uses the tricks he honed in freestyle practice to dodge Rodney's attacks and push him against the ropes repeatedly, finally stating that they both had a lot of things to be mad about, but fighting would not improve them.
Jump In!	72	95	He leaves the ring, and Rodney angrily follows, but trips on the rope and falls on his back.
Jump In!	73	95	Everyone urges Izzy to finish him, but he refuses, stating that he's tired of being mad before leaving the gym.
Jump In!	74	95	Rodney looks after him, the narrator revealing that he too was tired of being mad, and was impressed that Izzy had stood up to him.
Jump In!	75	95	Meanwhile, Mary, Keisha and Shauna meet up for the city finals, having found an abysmal replacement for Izzy with Shauna's cousin Alberna, who is practically blind.
Jump In!	76	95	Izzy arrives and apologizes to Mary, who jokes around with him and smiles before handing him a uniform, and all is forgiven.
Jump In!	77	95	They once again face the Dutch Dragons before the match, Gina and Yolanda snarking at them, confident that they would win.
Jump In!	78	95	The Hot Chili Steppers ignore them and affirm their solidarity before beginning the competition, Chuck, Earl, Tammy, and even Rodney showing up to watch.
Jump In!	79	95	With Mary's stellar performance, the Hot Chili Steppers take first place in the compulsory competition, while the Dutch Dragons take second, much to their astonishment.
Jump In!	80	95	In the speed competition, Yolanda beats Izzy by just six steps, tying them for first place and leaving freestyle to determine the winner.
Jump In!	81	95	Other teams compete while the Hot Chili Steppers look on, and then the Dutch Dragons take their turn.
Jump In!	82	95	The Hot Chili Steppers take the stage immediately after them, and while doing so, Izzy sees his father and sister entering the arena, greeting him with a smile.
Jump In!	83	95	Thus encouraged, the Hot Chili Steppers take the stage, performing a series of freestyle jumprope tricks in conjunction with a dance number, for which they earn tumultuous applause.
Jump In!	84	95	Izzy meets his father afterwards while the judges decide the winners, and he apologizes for pushing boxing so hard, having done it motivated by wanting to connect with Izzy.
Jump In!	85	95	He accepts that boxing is his dream, not Izzy's, and says how proud he is of what he had done.
Jump In!	86	95	He then meets his friends, who state that they've been enlightened, and Chuck embraces Tammy while Earl feigns nausea.
Jump In!	87	95	Finally, seeing Rodney, he confronts him, surprised to find his hostility gone and him admitting that the Double Dutch was cool.
Jump In!	88	95	They agree on a truce, and Izzy agrees to teach his moves to Rodney later to use in the ring.
Jump In!	89	95	At last, the judges announce the winners of the State Championship, announcing the third-place winner as the Kung Fu Flyers, and the second place team as the Dutch Dragons.
Jump In!	90	95	As he is about to announce the first place team, however, the scene cuts to the gym, revealing that Rodney, a couple of years after the event, was telling the story to a group of kids, boxers in training.
Jump In!	91	95	He reveals that the Hot Chili Steppers went to the State Championship, but did not win until the following year, and that Izzy and Mary were still going strong as a couple.
Jump In!	92	95	His voiceover states that he tells kids that story all the time, but you would have had to be there that day.
Jump In!	93	95	The scene cuts back to the judge announcing the Hot Chili Steppers as the first-place winners, who ecstatically accept their first-place trophy while the Dutch Dragons look in disbelief.

Flipped	0	53	Juli Baker meets Bryce Loski two weeks before the beginning of second grade; it's something about those blue eyes that attract her.
Flipped	1	53	Julianna knows it's love, while Bryce, like any seven-year-old boy, doesn't.
Flipped	2	53	Julianna stalks Bryce all through his childhood; staring at his house, asking him to play, following him at school, etc.
Flipped	3	53	Every day, Bryce watches Julianna climb the sycamore tree at the bus stop, from which Julianna always watches the town.
Flipped	4	53	She constantly asks Bryce to come join her in the tree, as well as yelling out how far away the bus is.
Flipped	5	53	Bryce, being unbelievably shy and annoyed by all the attention, asks out Juli's arch enemy, Shelly Stalls, to get rid of his admirer.
Flipped	6	53	Bryce looks over his shoulder for Julianna every time he's with Shelly, which causes Julianna to think he's being forced to date her.
Flipped	7	53	This provokes a catfight between Juli and Shelly over Bryce.
Flipped	8	53	The two break up, and Bryce is back to square one.
Flipped	9	53	There comes an incident in sixth grade when, much to Bryce's chagrin and irritation, Juli constantly sniffs Bryce's hair in spelling from her assigned position behind him.
Flipped	10	53	According to Juli, his hair smells like watermelon and he has blond earlobe fuzz.
Flipped	11	53	Bryce is disgruntled from this seat change, because Juli had initially sat next to him where he could see her answers and copy off of them.
Flipped	12	53	Now that she's behind him, he's lost that advantage, and his grades slip, especially in spelling.
Flipped	13	53	This halts, however, when as Juli sniffs him, she begins to whisper answers in his ear.
Flipped	14	53	Bryce, torn between feeling grateful and awkwardly guilty for hating her so much when she's helping him, follows the answers anyway until the end of the year.
Flipped	15	53	Juli, on the other hand, can't stop thinking about Bryce in the many years she's known him.
Flipped	16	53	Obliviously missing his discomfort being around her, she continues to try to get him to like her.
Flipped	17	53	However, Juli's motives change when her beloved sycamore tree is cut down.
Flipped	18	53	Although Juli stays up in the branches for hours and misses school to protest its excision, she is brought down and isn't the same for weeks.
Flipped	19	53	Unbeknownst to Juli, Bryce feels horribly about Juli's tree, considering Juli asked Bryce to come up to protest with her and he declined.
Flipped	20	53	He frets over whether he could have made a difference, and contemplates many times apologizing to Juli but chickens out each time.
Flipped	21	53	Matters aren't helped when Bryce's wise but stubborn grandfather takes a fond liking to Juli and pesters Bryce to be friends with her‚Äîhe doesn't seem to understand Bryce's annoyance with the girl.
Flipped	22	53	Juli's spirits are lightened when her father, who she admires more than anyone, paints her a picture of her sycamore tree.
Flipped	23	53	Juli often sits out with her dad on the porch for hours, listening to him talk and watching him paint.
Flipped	24	53	Juli hangs the picture in her room so she'll always be reminded of what the tree represented for her.
Flipped	25	53	Things with Juli start to change when Juli gives Bryce and his family a batch of chicken eggs.
Flipped	26	53	Bryce's father immediately expresses concern that the eggs might be fertilized, so Bryce and his best friend, Garrett, sneak over to her house and try to spy on the chickens in her backyard in search of a rooster (The chickens are a result of Juli's winning science fair project, which Bryce is a bit bitter about but means a lot to Juli) And Bryce doesn't know about the difference between chickens, hens, and roosters, so they head home without answers.
Flipped	27	53	Bryce's family, however, has a new concern,salmonella.
Flipped	28	53	Juli's yard has always been very messy, and the family is concerned about poison in the eggs.
Flipped	29	53	Bryce's father tells him to just say no to Juli about the eggs, but Bryce ends up just throwing the eggs away before his parents come down for breakfast.
Flipped	30	53	This goes on for two years, but ends when Juli catches Bryce throwing the eggs into the trash can and tells him she's lost over a hundred dollars giving him the eggs when she's been selling them to her neighbors.
Flipped	31	53	She runs home, leaving Bryce feeling miserable.
Flipped	32	53	Things take a dive for the worse in eighth grade when Juli overhears Bryce talking to Garrett about her mentally challenged uncle.
Flipped	33	53	Bryce wants to punch him (to be exact "slug him"), but doesn't want to lose his friend, so he pretends to laugh.
Flipped	34	53	Juli, furious and hurt, decides to abandon every thought of Bryce, even though Bryce's grandpa is very good friends with Juli and helps her tame her yard.
Flipped	35	53	The flip comes here: the more angry Juli is and the more she ignores him, the more Bryce notices and likes Juli, especially after he finds an old article about Juli's protest for her tree from elementary school.
Flipped	36	53	Bryce begins to see that Juli is smart, spirited and "iridescent", as Grandpa Chet calls her.
Flipped	37	53	And for once, Bryce can't get Juli out of his head, and Juli hates Bryce the way Bryce hated her.
Flipped	38	53	The climax comes at the eighth grade basket boys' luncheon, an auction in which boys are sold off to win money for charity.

Flipped	40	53	Bryce, being incredibly cute, gets auctioned off to Shelly and Miranda, the prettiest girls in his school, and Juli buys Jon out of pity, a boy who didn't get any offers.
Flipped	41	53	While on their lunch date, Bryce finds he can't focus on Shelly and Miranda: he just wants to talk to Juli.
Flipped	42	53	He gets his chance when Shelly and Miranda get into a huge food fight over him.
Flipped	43	53	While they're fighting, Bryce sneaks over to Juli's table, pulls her away from her date, and asks if she likes Jon.
Flipped	44	53	She answers that no, she doesn't, but is clearly still annoyed at Bryce and wants nothing to do with him.
Flipped	45	53	Bryce, in his relief, takes her hands, leans in and tries to kiss her, but she yanks back and runs away.
Flipped	46	53	Unfortunately for Bryce, this act is witnessed in front of his entire class, so he is dogged the rest of the day by taunts, especially by his friend Garrett.
Flipped	47	53	It is implied that Bryce drops Garrett as a friend in favor of Juli by the end.
Flipped	48	53	Juli manages to get home without Bryce seeing her, but Bryce is determined now.
Flipped	49	53	He calls, knocks on her door, and eventually climbs her window.
Flipped	50	53	Juli ignores him by sitting in the living room, until she looks out the window and sees Bryce's last attempt at winning her heart: he plants a sycamore tree in her backyard.
Flipped	51	53	Juli now realizes Bryce has changed and waves back at him from her living room window.
Flipped	52	53	And at that moment Juli realizes that Bryce loves her and he wants her to give him a second chance.

Smart People	0	28	Carnegie Mellon English Professor Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) is a widowed parent of his alienated college son, James (Ashton Holmes), overachieving high school daughter, Vanessa (Ellen Page), and sibling to his adopted ne'er-do-well brother, Chuck (Thomas Haden Church) that he cannot evade enough.
Smart People	1	28	The professor is bitter, arrogant, self-absorbed and uninterested in his students; this does not help him when he parks illegally on campus, his car is impounded and does not pay his fine before getting to the college impound lot watched by a flunked former student.
Smart People	2	28	Lawrence suffers a trauma-induced seizure after falling from the top of a fence in an attempt to retrieve his briefcase from inside his impounded car.
Smart People	3	28	In the emergency room, he is treated by dr Janet Hartigan (Parker), a former student he does not remember.
Smart People	4	28	Lawrence has to figure out a way to get about without being able to operate his car; Chuck is without a place to sleep and a job so Vanessa sets things up for what he characterizes as a "win/win" situation.
Smart People	5	28	Lawrence goes to the hospital for a follow-up, where another doctor tells him Janet had been his student.
Smart People	6	28	He meets Janet again outside the hospital as he is leaving and, since Chuck has failed to show up, she offers to take him home.
Smart People	7	28	When they arrive, he asks Janet to join him for a "face-to-face conversation".

Smart People	12	28	They get back to Janet's place where they have sex, but while spending the night, Janet is turned off by Lawrence's neediness and worries that he is, in fact, still too distraught by his wife's death.
Smart People	13	28	To get rid of him, she feigns being called in by the hospital and does not return any of his subsequent calls.
Smart People	14	28	On another night, in the midst of a contentious family Christmas dinner at the Wetherholds', Janet arrives unannounced with a cake.
Smart People	15	28	After Chuck gets Vanessa drunk to celebrate her early acceptance into Stanford University, she makes a pass at him, which he rejects.
Smart People	16	28	He then moves in part-time with Lawrence's son, James (Ashton Holmes), in his college dormitory.
Smart People	17	28	James' girlfriend, Missy (Camille Mana), who is one of his father's students, tells Lawrence that James has had a poem accepted by The New Yorker.
Smart People	18	28	In contrast, Lawrence's latest academic tome has been universally rejected.
Smart People	19	28	After Vanessa suggests a new title, You Can't Read.
Smart People	20	28	, the book is sold to Penguin Group, a large non-academic publisher in New York.
Smart People	21	28	To Lawrence's dismay, however, the book is largely re-worked and edited by the publisher and only vaguely resembles his original work.
Smart People	22	28	Janet accompanies Lawrence on a trip to New York to meet with the publisher, where she learns she is pregnant with his child.
Smart People	23	28	Finding him preoccupied by his book's publishing and an ongoing campaign to become chairman of the English Department, Janet is again upset by Lawrence's self-absorption and breaks up with him without telling him the news.
Smart People	24	28	Back in Pittsburgh, Lawrence is confronted by both James and Chuck, who both point to his apparent lack of interest in his children's lives.
Smart People	25	28	Encouraged by Chuck, Lawrence goes to the hospital to reconcile with Janet, who reveals her pregnancy.
Smart People	26	28	He has meanwhile dropped his bid to become department head and has become a more involved parent and professor.
Smart People	27	28	During the end credits, Lawrence and Janet cradle twin babies: one boy and one girl.

Eagle vs Shark	33	64	The two go to the beach and Lily finds a rock shaped like a heart that she shows Jarrod.
Eagle vs Shark	34	64	He tells her that he must break up with her, as he's too busy with the revenge mission and "too complex" for a relationship.
Eagle vs Shark	35	64	Lily is visibly upset but tries to hide it.
Eagle vs Shark	36	64	Jarrod takes flowers over to Tracy's house and spends the day with her on the beach trying to impress her with his "fighting skills".

Eagle vs Shark	41	64	Lily and the girl continue up the hill where the girl says that "That's where my Uncle Gordon died", revealing that Gordon did not die saving a child from a fire as Jarrod had said, but by committing suicide.
Eagle vs Shark	42	64	They return home and the family eats dinner.
Eagle vs Shark	43	64	Lily tells a silly joke and the whole group gets along very well.
Eagle vs Shark	44	64	Jarrod comes home to find the group laughing and then kills the mood by saying that he'd been with Tracy all day and that they'd been laughing harder.
Eagle vs Shark	45	64	Jarrod's father Jonah spends most of his time watching an old tape of Gordon winning a cross country meet and reliving the victory that he felt at that time.
Eagle vs Shark	46	64	In the video, Gordon wins the race and is congratulated obsessively by his father.
Eagle vs Shark	47	64	Tracy comes over and the two are celebrating.
Eagle vs Shark	48	64	Jarrod then attempts to come over and is pushed away by the father.
Eagle vs Shark	49	64	Seeing his father watching this and feeling even more alienated, Jarrod falsely announces that he is dating Tracy.
Eagle vs Shark	50	64	Jonah is crushed.
Eagle vs Shark	51	64	Lily, annoyed by this, leaves the house and takes her sleeping bag from the tent, choosing to sleep over on the other side of the yard instead, stubbornly refusing Jarrod's offer to use it.
Eagle vs Shark	52	64	He moves the tent to her and sleeps inside it, although it collapses on top of him.
Eagle vs Shark	53	64	Annoyed by Jarrod's behavior, Lily decides to go with Doug and Nancy to a local party.
Eagle vs Shark	54	64	She gets very drunk and dances with a lot of boys while Jarrod jealously looks on.
Eagle vs Shark	55	64	Eventually, she runs off, ripping off all her clothes and sleeping in the bushes somewhere.
Eagle vs Shark	56	64	In the morning, she returns, and Jarrod tells her he didn't get any sleep that night worrying about her.
Eagle vs Shark	57	64	That afternoon, Jarrod, with his family and friends watching, confronts Eric and finds out that Eric is paralyzed and uses a wheelchair.
Eagle vs Shark	58	64	Eric apologizes for how he bullied him in high school, but Jarrod attacks him anyway with a set of nunchucks.

Casual Sex?	2	59	As a concierge gift, they receive a basket filled with condoms.
Casual Sex?	3	59	At the spa, Stacy meets Nick (Stephen Shellen), a struggling musician whom she is taken with, and also encounters Vinny, aka the Vin Man (Andrew Dice Clay), an annoying Italian-American man from New Jersey whom she tries to avoid.
Casual Sex?	4	59	At the resort's International Night, the men and women all take miniature flags of various countries and put them in plunger-shaped hats, then meet the person with the identical national flag.
Casual Sex?	5	59	After becoming demoralized by a bad experience at the flag party, Melissa writes a letter that she leaves for Stacy saying she is returning to LA.
Casual Sex?	6	59	However, Melissa connects with a spa staff member, Jamie (Jerry Levine), who has taken an apparent liking to her and yet who is very sweet, respectful and supportive of her.
Casual Sex?	7	59	Some days later, when they are intimate, she experiences her very first orgasm.
Casual Sex?	8	59	Meanwhile, Stacy finds Melissa's letter to her and, thinking that Melissa has left the resort alone in frustration, immediately returns to LA herself via the 2:00pm bus, not knowing that Melissa has remained at the resort.
Casual Sex?	9	59	Stacy had taken Nick with her back to LA and, once there, falls back into old behavior patterns of being a crutch for men.
Casual Sex?	10	59	She lets Nick move in with her to try to get his fledgling music career off the ground.
Casual Sex?	11	59	However, Stacy soon realizes that Nick's quirky habits (eg, not having a checking account or a credit card, carrying all his personal belongings in plastic trash bags) and idiosyncratic ways of thinking (not having his life together at this age and stage of life) are things that she cannot adapt to.
Casual Sex?	12	59	She realizes that she actually doesn't really like him or see him as the man she thought he was back at the resort.
Casual Sex?	13	59	Upon learning that Melissa is back at the resort and never even left, she hurriedly rents a pink Cadillac and drives all the way back, where she accidentally walks in on Melissa in bed with Jamie.
Casual Sex?	14	59	Outside the room, Melissa tells Stacy about Jamie and how they have bonded with one another.
Casual Sex?	15	59	Stacey is relieved that Melissa is in good spirits now and is thrilled that she and Jamie have found each other.

Casual Sex?	18	59	Leaving the resort, she comes across Vinny waiting near the exit with his luggage in tow.
Casual Sex?	19	59	He flags her down and begs her to let him in the car so she can drop him off at the nearest bus station.
Casual Sex?	20	59	He wants to leave the health resort as well and, without prompting, Vinny promises not to come on to her or do anything else of the sort.
Casual Sex?	21	59	Reluctantly, Stacy lets him get into the car with her but, this time, he does not come on to her or act pushy and desperate.
Casual Sex?	22	59	Instead, on the drive to the bus station, they speak frankly and candidly with each other about their disappointment with their experience at the health resort.
Casual Sex?	23	59	Vinny lets his guard down and speaks plainly about how he really just doesn't understand the world of male and female relationships and how it all works.
Casual Sex?	24	59	He asks Stacy, "How do you do it, this male, female, relationship thing.
Casual Sex?	25	59	How do you do it.
Casual Sex?	26	59	" Stacy shares that she is in "relationship hell" at the moment, which surprises Vinny (as he is and has been enamored of Stacy thus far, viewing her as a very desirable woman and an all-around winner).
Casual Sex?	27	59	When she asks him what he looks for in a woman, she is touched by what he shares with her and gets a new, enlightened view of him (ie, that there is more to Vinny than the desperate, pathetic, trying-too-hard act she saw in him at the resort).
Casual Sex?	28	59	Upon returning to New Jersey and thereafter, Vinny experiences changes in his attitude toward women and how he sees his life moving forward.
Casual Sex?	29	59	He keeps in touch with Stacy via handwritten letters, sharing with her the epiphanies he is experiencing and how he is becoming a different person and his life is advancing and improving.
Casual Sex?	30	59	Meanwhile, back in her home, Stacy has confronted Nick and told him their relationship won't work.
Casual Sex?	31	59	Nick is taken aback, acts hurt, and defiantly says that he sees himself as on the way to making it big in the music business and way beyond even what she can ever envision and that she will regret her decision.
Casual Sex?	32	59	She wishes him the best and he storms out with his belongings.
Casual Sex?	33	59	At this point, Stacy is relieved that it has ended and she is determined to take a break from men-at-large for an unspecified span of time to sort things out in her head.
Casual Sex?	34	59	Some time later, Stacy visits Melissa and Jamie, who now live together in their own home.
Casual Sex?	35	59	At the end of the evening, Stacy says goodbye to Melissa and Jamie.
Casual Sex?	36	59	She walks home by herself, where she finds Vinny waiting for her in a fancy limousine.
Casual Sex?	37	59	He has gone into business for himself running a limousine service and owns a whole fleet of limousines.
Casual Sex?	38	59	He shares with Stacy that he started driving from his home in New Jersey just to take a drive and, the next thing he knew, he found himself in Chicago, Illinois.
Casual Sex?	39	59	He then asked himself, "Vinny, where are you going.
Casual Sex?	40	59	" He says he realized that he was driving to see Stacy.
Casual Sex?	41	59	He wound up driving all the way from New Jersey to southern California just to see her.
Casual Sex?	42	59	Stacy is taken with this and yet, when he asks her if she'd like to talk or go someplace together, she initially is hesitant and says to him that it was very late.
Casual Sex?	43	59	Vinny, being a gentleman this time (in contrast with their past times together) acts with reserve and respectfully takes her cue.
Casual Sex?	44	59	Stacy apparently is moved by this and, seeing how he drove all the way from New Jersey to California just to see her, she calls out to him and says that, if he likes, he can come home with her and she can make him breakfast.
Casual Sex?	45	59	He pauses a bit, turns around, and says that he is rather hungry, accepts her invitation, and even offers to be the one who makes breakfast.
Casual Sex?	46	59	He says he has a gift for her.
Casual Sex?	47	59	He walks over to the limousine, opens the door, reaches in, and presents an adorable Golden Retriever puppy to Stacy.
Casual Sex?	48	59	She falls in love with Vinny while the puppy is licking her face.
Casual Sex?	49	59	They leave together with the new puppy.

Casual Sex?	51	59	Stacy and Vinny are now married with two small boys and a fully-grown Golden Retriever.
Casual Sex?	52	59	As Vinny is greeting Jamie with his two boys and dog and having a great time with all, Stacy and Melissa are at a distance standing together and looking toward their two significant others.

Casual Sex?	54	59	Stacy says to Melissa, "There's your boyfriend".
Casual Sex?	55	59	Melissa replies, "So what, there's yours".
Casual Sex?	56	59	Finally, Stacy says to the camera, "Yeah, that's my boyfriend".

Ten Inch Hero	6	46	Fuzzy22 has asked Jen to meet him in person, to which she reluctantly agrees, though Jen is very nervous&mdash;she and Fuzzy22 had agreed to not exchange any identifying information, so she has no idea how old he is, what he looks like, or if he is male or female.

Ten Inch Hero	11	46	She cares a great deal about Fuzzy22, and feels that a man as attractive as he is would, upon seeing her, become disappointed and uninterested and she could not bear that from him.
Ten Inch Hero	12	46	Although the two friends try to convince Jen to go back and meet with him, she refuses, so they drive back to Santa Cruz.
Ten Inch Hero	13	46	Piper goes out on a date with Noah, and she prepares to tell him the truth about herself, but he first wants to share something: the reason he has been reluctant to talk about Julia's mother is that she lives on the east coast and severely abused Julia, leading to divorce and a court order that the mother is not allowed to contact Julia until her 18th birthday.

Ten Inch Hero	22	46	Tish asserts that he and Brad are gay, but will not admit it to themselves so they use the pretense of a threesome to have sex with each other.

Ten Inch Hero	28	46	He vowed never to commit any violence against a human being again.

Ten Inch Hero	32	46	Trucker realizes he doesn't have to hide his past from Zo because she already knows who he really is.
Ten Inch Hero	33	46	He finally works up the courage to ask her out, to which she happily agrees.
Ten Inch Hero	34	46	She has had a crush on him since high school, when she was a shy freshman, and even though it is decades later, she says that many still carry high school within themselves, so she could never show Trucker how she felt despite now being a confident and secure woman.
Ten Inch Hero	35	46	Piper and Noah have another talk, and he forgives her for lying and asks her if she still wants to be a part of the family.
Ten Inch Hero	36	46	She happily agrees.
Ten Inch Hero	37	46	At the shop, a homeless man comes in and tells Jen that he thinks she's really pretty, and that she's exactly who he had hoped she'd be.
Ten Inch Hero	38	46	He then removes his homeless disguise and reveals himself to be Fuzzy22.
Ten Inch Hero	39	46	He introduces himself to Jen and they happily hug.
Ten Inch Hero	40	46	Priestly reveals that when Jen forgot to log off the computer one night, he talked to Fuzzy22 and told him the situation and how to meet Jen.
Ten Inch Hero	41	46	The next day, Priestly comes to the shop and is almost unrecognizable, dressed in Banana Republic khakis and an Oxford shirt, piercings removed, his hair parted down the middle with bright colors washed out, tattoos mostly hidden, and no punk makeup, and finally asks Tish out.
Ten Inch Hero	42	46	He had been hinting throughout the movie that he was interested in her, but was frustrated because she seemed to never notice him and she was wasting her time with shallow relationships with guys she could manipulate, rather than seeking emotional intimacy.
Ten Inch Hero	43	46	She agrees to go out on a date with him but only on the condition that he tell her his first name, which turns out to be Boaz.
Ten Inch Hero	44	46	She then reveals that her first name is actually Platisha.
Ten Inch Hero	45	46	The movie ends with all the new couples at the beach for Zo and Trucker's commitment ceremony to each other, at which they arrive riding horses, naked.

She's Out of My League	11	33	The two begin to date after this, with Kirk confiding in her his dream of becoming a pilot someday, though Stainer predicts their relationship will fail as he deems Molly a "10" in a scale of attractiveness, and Kirk only a "5", telling him a girl he loved once broke up with him for this very reason.
She's Out of My League	12	33	Patty, for her part, believes Molly had only chosen Kirk because he was a "safe" choice after being hurt by her last boyfriend, Air Force pilot Cam (Geoff Stults), who assumes Kirk is a waiter and attempts to order drinks from Kirk when they first meet, and then believing Kirk to be a homosexual friend of Molly's.

She's Out of My League	21	33	To add to his troubles, Molly's macho ex-boyfriend Cam shows up and messes with Kirk by deliberately alluding to Molly having some sort of "defect".
She's Out of My League	22	33	After the party, both of them go back to Molly's apartment and make out, where Kirk discovers Molly's "defect" is slightly webbed toes, which Kirk considers so minor that he decides that she is indeed too perfect for him.

She's Out of My League	28	33	Kirk rejects Marnie during an unorthodox airport pursuit and meets Molly in the airport where she tells him that he is out of shape and she asked him out because she thought he was safe and wouldn't hurt her.
She's Out of My League	29	33	She then continues to tell him that she doesn't care what he is employed as and that she misses him and wants to be together with him.
She's Out of My League	30	33	Kirk and Molly then make up and resume their relationship, even if their friends don't approve it.

The House Bunny	0	25	Shelley Darlington (Anna Faris) is an aspiring Playboy Playmate living the life of luxury in the Playboy Mansion.
The House Bunny	1	25	The day after her twenty-seventh birthday, she awakes to find a note, seemingly from Hugh Hefner, asking her to pack up and leave.
The House Bunny	2	25	She happens to stumble upon a group of girls who remind her of herself: beautiful and fun.
The House Bunny	3	25	She follows them and sees that they live in luxury too.
The House Bunny	4	25	They turn out to be the Phi Iota Mu sorority, and snobbishly reject her when she tries to join them.
The House Bunny	5	25	She makes her way down to the Zeta Alpha Zeta house, which appears to be far less luxurious than the first sorority she visited.
The House Bunny	6	25	The members of the Zeta house are dowdy, socially awkward, and caught off guard by Shelley's bubbly nature, prompting them to initially reject her.
The House Bunny	7	25	Once they see Shelley's ability to attract boys, the Zetas change their mind and take in Shelley as their new "house mother", hoping that she can save them: their sorority is in danger of being shut down unless they can get thirty new pledges to join.

The House Bunny	9	25	Shelley goes out on a date with Oliver, and while her flirty tactics work with most guys, they fail with him, for he is a guy who actually wants to get to know Shelley rather than just sleep with her.
The House Bunny	10	25	To impress Oliver on their upcoming second date, Shelley starts attending classes and reading books, and tones down her appearance.
The House Bunny	11	25	The second date is also a disaster because she wears glasses that aren't meant for her, and brings along note cards to help her sound smart.
The House Bunny	12	25	Having gotten a makeover and lessons on how to attract guys and be popular, the Zetas throw a party, which is a huge success.
The House Bunny	13	25	Later, the Zetas are reviewing the girls who are hoping to pledge to Zeta, but their new popularity has made them conceited.
The House Bunny	14	25	When they realize what they've become, they blame Shelley‚Äîjust as she returns from her unsuccessful date.
The House Bunny	15	25	Although Shelley had just been invited back to the Playboy mansion (after Hefner had learned of the forged dismissal) and decided to stay with the Zetas, the unexpected attack from them makes her reconsider, and she calls back to accept the invitation.
The House Bunny	16	25	The Zetas then feel guilty, and decide to give themselves a second makeover, this time being "Half-Shelley and Half-Themselves".
The House Bunny	17	25	They also decide to draw the pledges out at random, instead of judging them.
The House Bunny	18	25	They show up at Shelley's photo shoot and ask for her to come back, to which she agrees, having changed her mind about her dream of being a centerfold.
The House Bunny	19	25	The rival Phi Iota Mu sorority intercepts the invitations and prevents them from being mailed out, so the Zetas are again in danger of being shut down at the campus meeting of the Panhellenic Council.
The House Bunny	20	25	Shelley crashes the meeting and gives a heartfelt speech about what her experience with the Zetas has taught her about love and acceptance, and asks for pledges on the spot; gradually thirty students agree to pledge, and the sorority is saved.
The House Bunny	21	25	Oliver and Shelley reconcile, and Shelley explains that she likes Oliver a lot and was trying too hard to impress him.
The House Bunny	22	25	They decide to start over with their relationship and Oliver is looking forward to getting to know the "real" Shelley.

The Model and the Marriage Broker	17	24	Kitty reluctantly takes the absent Mae's place.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	18	24	Then Mae's friend Doberman explains how badly she hurt Mae, that Mae thought of her as the daughter she never had, and that Mae helps those who are shy, need a helpful push, or are not as pretty as Kitty.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	19	24	Afterward, Kitty tries to arrange a relationship for Mae with Dan Chancellor, a wealthy Canadian bachelor who had heard of Mae's service.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	20	24	Mae and Kitty become friends again, but Mae comes to realize she herself will never be lonely as long as she has people to help.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	21	24	She decides that Dan would actually be a better match for Emmy.
The Model and the Marriage Broker	22	24	In addition, Matt realizes he wants to marry Kitty after all, and gets her to agree to it.

The Fighting Temptations	1	41	Aunt Sally Walker (Ann Nesby), Darrin's great-aunt, attempts to defend MaryAnn but fails, and the church's pastor, Reverend Paul Lewis (Wendell Pierce), is too afraid of the other church members to let her stay.

The Fighting Temptations	12	41	Upon taking charge of the once-powerful choir, Darrin discovers that it has fallen into decline over the years, with only a handful of members remaining.
The Fighting Temptations	13	41	He also faces opposition from Reverend Lewis's sister, Paulina Prickett (LaTanya Richardson), the church's high-strung and wicked treasurer, and the same woman who led the townspeople into driving Darrin and his mother out of Monte Carlo years before.

The Fighting Temptations	33	41	However, Reverend Lewis finally stands up to Paulina and calls her out for being a selfish, conniving, hypocritical individual.
The Fighting Temptations	34	41	He then reveals to the choir that her husband, whom she previously had claimed was deceased, is alive and remarried to a better woman.

Un couple √©patant	53	72	She tells him that he must do something, but by then his paranoia has kicked in and he has begun adding up facts into a big scheme to kill him, which also involves his children, based on the song that they sang to him at his birthday and the changes that they made to fit him (the song involves the story of a poor boy who has to steal flowers for his dying mother in the hospital, only to find that when he finally arrives, she is already dead), Alain changes his will again: all goes to Claire.
Un couple √©patant	54	72	As they talk, enters Vincent, Claire's boyfriend and an employee of Alain's who is back home due to a working accident, but Alain does not believe him since the prescription is signed by dr Georges Colinet, thus Vincent is in the plot too.

Warm Bodies	0	85	In a post-apocalyptic future, a male zombie still in the early stages of decay lives in a community of the Dead in an abandoned airport near the city.
Warm Bodies	1	85	He refers to himself as ‚ÄúR‚Äù since he cannot remember his full name, among other details of his life.
Warm Bodies	2	85	R reveals through first person narrative that human civilization has been destroyed by wars and disasters, resulting in a mysterious zombie plague.
Warm Bodies	3	85	Now whole communities of zombies live in hives, and are separated into two categories based on the amount of decay: Fleshies, the Dead who still have flesh on them, and Boneys, the Dead who have been reduced to nothing more than skeletons with bits of muscle keeping them together.
Warm Bodies	4	85	The Boneys are basically the leaders of the Dead, and are seemingly stronger and more intelligent than Fleshies.
Warm Bodies	5	85	They can only be killed if their brains are destroyed.
Warm Bodies	6	85	The zombies are very lethargic for the most part, have limited speech and short memories, and are notably illiterate.
Warm Bodies	7	85	They live in what is a mere, twisted shadow of a normal society.
Warm Bodies	8	85	One of the few times they are truly focused and animated is when they go hunting for the Living, their only food source, during which they spontaneously form a hunting party.
Warm Bodies	9	85	The brain is the best part, because if they eat it, then they can relive the memories, feelings, and thoughts of their prey.
Warm Bodies	10	85	Anything that‚Äôs left of the prey is brought back for the others to eat.
Warm Bodies	11	85	R is portrayed as unusual, since he not only contains more empathy and intuition than his fellow Dead, but is also able to express it better than most of them despite being Dead.
Warm Bodies	12	85	He openly shows distaste for eating human flesh, and is the only zombie there who is able to form four, coherent syllables in one breath.
Warm Bodies	13	85	After a hunt, he meets a zombie woman, and they quickly become girlfriend and boyfriend.
Warm Bodies	14	85	She takes him to church where a Bony preacher sees them, and marries them on impulse.
Warm Bodies	15	85	The next day, R and his new wife are presented with two Dead children.
Warm Bodies	16	85	Seeing them try to play like Living children depresses R, and he is gripped with a feeding frenzy.
Warm Bodies	17	85	He leads a hunting party to the city where they find a group of young adults scavenging supplies.
Warm Bodies	18	85	Attacking with unusual energy, R feeds on the brain of a young man named Perry.
Warm Bodies	19	85	After experiencing his memories, R sees Perry‚Äôs girlfriend Julie, and in a moment of mercy, saves her from the others.
Warm Bodies	20	85	He disguises her scent with zombie blood, and takes her home where he hides her in a 747 airplane.
Warm Bodies	21	85	The airplane is R‚Äôs ‚Äúhouse‚Äù where he can have some privacy, and hoard the interesting objects he finds.
Warm Bodies	22	85	He slowly gains Julie‚Äôs trust, and convinces her to stay for a while until the others forget about her (though in reality, he just really likes her).
Warm Bodies	23	85	Throughout the week, R feeds her food from the airport‚Äôs restaurant, entertains her with his treasures, including a record player, and Julie tries to teach him to drive a car which R has managed to get started.
Warm Bodies	24	85	She also tells him a little bit about her life.
Warm Bodies	25	85	In time, R begins feeling guilty over killing Perry, which is made worse since Julie doesn‚Äôt know it was him, and is giving him the benefit of the doubt.
Warm Bodies	26	85	Despite his guilt, R continues eating the remains of Perry‚Äôs brain, seeing it as a rare treasure.
Warm Bodies	27	85	One night, R eats the last of the brain, and experiences the last of Perry‚Äôs memories.
Warm Bodies	28	85	When he begins to witness Perry‚Äôs death however, R‚Äôs thoughts interrupt the scene in an attempt to halt it.
Warm Bodies	29	85	To his shock, memory pauses, and Perry scolds him, telling him to let Perry have this memory.
Warm Bodies	30	85	R complies, and the memory plays through.
Warm Bodies	31	85	After it ends, R falls asleep.
Warm Bodies	32	85	When he awakens, Julie is being attacked by several zombies, including M, and R helps her fend them off.
Warm Bodies	33	85	M is confused and angry by R‚Äôs behavior, but R holds his ground.
Warm Bodies	34	85	Suddenly, some Boneys arrive.
Warm Bodies	35	85	Although they do not attack, one of them shows R some old photos of Dead and Living fighting each other, telling him that they need to maintain the status quo.
Warm Bodies	36	85	They leave along with the rest, and R takes Julie back to the airplane.
Warm Bodies	37	85	In the morning, Julie convinces R to take her home, and they attempt to leave while the Dead watch them, half-fascinated and half-afraid.
Warm Bodies	38	85	However, the Boneys attack and try to kill Julie, but with M‚Äôs help, they get away in R‚Äôs car.
Warm Bodies	39	85	On the way to the city, it starts raining, and they are forced to stop in the suburbs.
Warm Bodies	40	85	They camp out in one of the houses, and Julie allows R to share a bed with her.
Warm Bodies	41	85	To his surprise, R experiences some more of Perry‚Äôs memories, during which R has another conversation with ‚ÄúPerry‚Äù.
Warm Bodies	42	85	The next morning, Julie calls her father, and sends R out for fuel.
Warm Bodies	43	85	When he returns however, Julie is gone.
Warm Bodies	44	85	R begins walking back to the airport in a heavy rainstorm, and feels cold for the first time since he ‚Äúdied‚Äù.
Warm Bodies	45	85	On the road, R runs into M and some other zombies who have been chased out by the Boneys.
Warm Bodies	46	85	The zombies have been changing like R, and experiencing things such as dreams and old memories.
Warm Bodies	47	85	R decides to go after Julie, and recruits the other zombies‚Äô help to get inside the stadium.
Warm Bodies	48	85	Along the way, Perry shows R more of his memories, saying that he doesn‚Äôt want to leave yet.
Warm Bodies	49	85	When R and the others arrive at the stadium, he impersonates a Living person, and has his friends ‚Äúchase‚Äù him to its doors.
Warm Bodies	50	85	The soldiers let him in, and R sneaks through the stadium following Julie‚Äôs scent to her house.
Warm Bodies	51	85	R sees Julie on her balcony, and they reunite.
Warm Bodies	52	85	R also meets Nora, Julie‚Äôs best friend.
Warm Bodies	53	85	With no other options, the girls let him stay the night, and R has another Perry dream.
Warm Bodies	54	85	The next morning, the girls give R a major make-over to make him look human, and take him on a tour of the city.
Warm Bodies	55	85	They take him to the cemetery where they visit the grave of Julie‚Äôs mother, and Julie tells him how her mother died.
Warm Bodies	56	85	While there, R finds Perry‚Äôs grave, and has a waking vision of Perry.
Warm Bodies	57	85	By now, it‚Äôs become apparent that some form of Perry‚Äôs soul is living inside R, and has intertwined with R‚Äôs own.
Warm Bodies	58	85	Perry warns him of the changes to come, saying R needs to take control or be swept away.
Warm Bodies	59	85	The vision ends, and the three of them leave the cemetery.
Warm Bodies	60	85	After a tense run-in with Julie‚Äôs father, Grigio, they take him to a pub where Julie spikes their drinks with real alcohol, and R gets drunk.
Warm Bodies	61	85	He goes for a walk to clear his head, but runs into a soldier who realizes what he is, forcing R to attack him.
Warm Bodies	62	85	As R begins eating him, he regains control and stops, causing the soldier to reanimate as a zombie.
Warm Bodies	63	85	R runs back to Julie, and finally tells her that he killed Perry.
Warm Bodies	64	85	The Dead soldier is found and killed, but Grigio orders a widespread search to find the second zombie.
Warm Bodies	65	85	He arrives at the house, deduces what R really is, and attacks him despite Julie‚Äôs protests.
Warm Bodies	66	85	Nora holds a gun to Grigio, and Julie and R escape from the stadium.
Warm Bodies	67	85	Outside, the crowd of zombies has grown.
Warm Bodies	68	85	What Julie and R have between them has infected many others, causing them to change.
Warm Bodies	69	85	As they deliberate on what to do next, the Boneys attack.
Warm Bodies	70	85	R and Julie flee back to the stadium in the hopes that the Living will kill them off, but the Boneys quickly gather in huge numbers, more than any have ever seen.
Warm Bodies	71	85	Julie is astounded by the siege, but Perry speaks to both of them inside their heads, and tells them that it‚Äôs because the Boneys are afraid of the change they represent.
Warm Bodies	72	85	The couple meets up with Nora, and they flee to a roof where they see the battle between the Boneys and the Living.
Warm Bodies	73	85	As they watch, Julie has an epiphany: the plague started because the human race crushed itself beneath the weight of its sins until it released a dark force that changed the humans so that everyone could see their evil.
Warm Bodies	74	85	In the midst of the chaos and bloodshed, R and Julie do the only thing they can think of: they kiss.
Warm Bodies	75	85	The strength of their love cures R of the plague completely and their eyes turn gold.
Warm Bodies	76	85	Suddenly, the moment is interrupted by Grigio, who is quickly descending into madness.
Warm Bodies	77	85	Grigio tries to kill them, but one of his soldiers intervenes, and Grigio nearly falls off the roof.
Warm Bodies	78	85	A Boney appears, and begins eating Grigio, who has finally given up.
Warm Bodies	79	85	Julie shoots it, and both fall off the roof as Grigio shrivels away into a pile of dust and bones.
Warm Bodies	80	85	The fight on the roof somehow causes the Boneys to give up, and they disperse.
Warm Bodies	81	85	After the battle, the Living decide to give the reviving Dead a chance, and let them try to assimilate into their society.
Warm Bodies	82	85	Those that haven‚Äôt started changing yet, either start to change or fade away into dust.
Warm Bodies	83	85	In light of the new beginnings, R has decided to remain ‚ÄúR‚Äù.
Warm Bodies	84	85	They still have a long way to go, but it‚Äôs a start.

Geek Charming	2	59	Josh Rosen is a film geek and aspiring filmmaker with a crush on Amy, a former friend of Dylan's.
Geek Charming	3	59	He is also the president of the school's dorky Film Club.
Geek Charming	4	59	Josh wants to make a documentary for the Puget Sound Film Festival, and decides to give himself a challenge, with his topic being popularity, and his subject being Dylan herself.
Geek Charming	5	59	Dylan, delighted to be in a movie, takes the opportunity; believing that with "her" movie, she could be crowned Blossom Queen.
Geek Charming	6	59	She instantly starts showing off and puts on an over-the-top, diva-like attitude.
Geek Charming	7	59	However, this leads to Josh "firing" her, having a heated argument about "whose" movie it is.
Geek Charming	8	59	After a while, Josh reconsiders her as his film subject after she sees the sci-fi movie "Flight of the Navigator" and she joins his club.
Geek Charming	9	59	Josh teaches Dylan a lesson about how the world doesn't revolve around her.
Geek Charming	10	59	After the movie, Dylan invites Josh to her house, where they make an "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sundae".
Geek Charming	11	59	While Dylan leaves briefly to go get something, Josh notices a wall of pictures, one of which has Dylan's mom in it, crowned the Blossom Queen.
Geek Charming	12	59	When Dylan comes back he asks her about it, and she says that her mom was Blossom Queen back in 1985.
Geek Charming	13	59	Her mom had died when she was in elementary school.
Geek Charming	14	59	She also admits that she feels more connected to her mom when accomplishing the same things she did.
Geek Charming	15	59	Josh's friends from the film club are angry at him for abandoning them for Dylan, and assume he has a crush, which Josh denies.
Geek Charming	16	59	He promises to attend the Mathlete Scavenger hunt the following Saturday.
Geek Charming	17	59	Dylan allows Josh to enter "the ramp," or the place in the cafeteria where the popular students sit, as a friend rather than a filmmaker.
Geek Charming	18	59	She advises Josh to talk to Amy, so he leaves, replaced by a disgruntled Asher.
Geek Charming	19	59	Meanwhile, Josh lands a date with Amy, and she says that Saturday is her day off.
Geek Charming	20	59	Forgetting that Saturday is the day of the scavenger hunt, he agrees.
Geek Charming	21	59	Later, Josh talks to Dylan, not knowing what to do (and still forgetting about the scavenger hunt), so Dylan invites him to a party at Asher's house.
Geek Charming	22	59	Josh picks up Amy the next day and takes her to the party, even though Amy is uncomfortable with the crowd.
Geek Charming	23	59	Josh realizes that he and Amy have a lot less in common than he originally thought, and she leaves to check out the music.
Geek Charming	24	59	Josh talks to Dylan and asks her for advice on how to interact with Amy, as he had never dated before.
Geek Charming	25	59	Asher and Amy catch them and Asher assumes they're secretly dating.
Geek Charming	26	59	After the party, Josh asks Amy out to the spring formal.
Geek Charming	27	59	Amy declines, stating that although Josh is not secretly dating Dylan, he wants to.
Geek Charming	28	59	The next day before school, Dylan's contacts fall down the drain, so she wears her nerdy black-and-brown glasses.
Geek Charming	29	59	At first she tries her best to make do with out them, but when she gets a note in class from Asher, she puts them on to read it, revealing her secret.
Geek Charming	30	59	To add insult to injury, the note says that Asher is breaking up with her.
Geek Charming	31	59	At lunch she wants Josh to sit with her, but Josh refuses and Dylan threatens him.
Geek Charming	32	59	Josh counters, saying "Or what.
Geek Charming	33	59	You're gonna ban me from the ramp.
Geek Charming	34	59	Your seat has already been taken.
Geek Charming	35	59	" Asher, now her ex-boyfriend, had given her chair to her biggest rival, Nicole Patterson, who is also a candidate for Blossom Queen.
Geek Charming	36	59	Dylan walks off again silently crying.
Geek Charming	37	59	Josh asks his friends what's wrong with Dylan.
Geek Charming	38	59	Upon hearing that Asher just broke up with her, Josh feels guilty.
Geek Charming	39	59	He also gets the news that he has been replaced by Caitlin as the film club president.
Geek Charming	40	59	To make matters worse for Dylan, Hannah and Lola also bail on her because they both had dates to the formal and Asher broke up with her for Nicole.
Geek Charming	41	59	Josh finishes his movie, after much delay, and shows it to the public.
Geek Charming	42	59	Dylan walks in and sits down.
Geek Charming	43	59	She expects the movie to help her win Blossom Queen, but she is totally disgusted with the movie after only seeing a bit of it.
Geek Charming	44	59	When the audience laughs at Dylan's behavior towards the beginning of Josh's film, dubbed "The Popularity Project", Dylan runs out crying as Josh runs after her.
Geek Charming	45	59	Dylan accuses Josh of publicly humiliating her and undoing all her efforts to be rid of her old self, and walks off after telling him to leave her alone.
Geek Charming	46	59	It is revealed that the movie actually contains a compliment to Dylan at the end that Dylan doesn't see.
Geek Charming	47	59	The next morning, Amy shows up at Dylan's house.
Geek Charming	48	59	She states that just because she stopped being friends with her in 6th grade didn't mean she stopped being friends, she figured Dylan's decisions were affected by the death of her mother.
Geek Charming	49	59	She then tells her that Josh is worried about her, that the film won the film festival and that she is more popular than ever.
Geek Charming	50	59	She gives Dylan a DVD of Josh's "terrible" film and tells her to watch 'all' of it before she decides that her social life is ruined.
Geek Charming	51	59	Later at the Spring Formal, Dylan shows up in her mother's dress, where Lola and Hannah ambush her, pulling her from Amy.
Geek Charming	52	59	When the "Blossom Queen" winner is announced; Dylan wins the title like her mother did, to Dylan's amazement and Nicole's horror and anger, as she storms off of the stage.
Geek Charming	53	59	Dylan then proceeds with a tearful impromptu apology for much of what she said in the film, and declares her feelings for Josh.
Geek Charming	54	59	She mentions her appreciation towards Amy for being her friend, and thanks Josh.
Geek Charming	55	59	They share a kiss and begin to dance.
Geek Charming	56	59	Also, Josh's friend, Ari, dances with Amy, and Josh's other friend, Steven, dances with Caitlin.
Geek Charming	57	59	In the end, Dylan and Josh are shown facing the camera and apologize for the names they called each other at first.
Geek Charming	58	59	They kiss again with Josh's jacket covering their faces.

Magic in the Moonlight	0	39	In 1928, a globally famous illusionist, Wei Ling Soo, performs in front of a crowd in Berlin with his world-class magic act.
Magic in the Moonlight	1	39	As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley (Colin Firth).
Magic in the Moonlight	2	39	He berates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well-wishers.
Magic in the Moonlight	3	39	In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney).
Magic in the Moonlight	4	39	Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the C√¥te d'Azur where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie (Emma Stone).
Magic in the Moonlight	5	39	In fact, the son of the family, Brice (Hamish Linklater), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister Caroline (Erica Leerhsen) and brother-in-law George (Jeremy Shamos) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage.
Magic in the Moonlight	6	39	Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the more he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers.
Magic in the Moonlight	7	39	So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud.
Magic in the Moonlight	8	39	Howard and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family.
Magic in the Moonlight	9	39	Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family.
Magic in the Moonlight	10	39	A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge.
Magic in the Moonlight	11	39	Stanley begins spending time with Sophie.
Magic in the Moonlight	12	39	He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky corniches.
Magic in the Moonlight	13	39	When Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate secret details of Vanessa's one great love affair.
Magic in the Moonlight	14	39	This finally convinces Stanley of Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided.
Magic in the Moonlight	15	39	When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child.
Magic in the Moonlight	16	39	After the rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars.
Magic in the Moonlight	17	39	At a Gatsby-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance.
Magic in the Moonlight	18	39	As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her "as a woman".
Magic in the Moonlight	19	39	Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for opening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way.
Magic in the Moonlight	20	39	She leaves upset.
Magic in the Moonlight	21	39	The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking charlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal.
Magic in the Moonlight	22	39	The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident.
Magic in the Moonlight	23	39	Stanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace.
Magic in the Moonlight	24	39	That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer.
Magic in the Moonlight	25	39	He begins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it.
Magic in the Moonlight	26	39	The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers.
Magic in the Moonlight	27	39	He decides once more to prove she is a fraud.
Magic in the Moonlight	28	39	Using a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse.
Magic in the Moonlight	29	39	He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much about him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley.
Magic in the Moonlight	30	39	Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard.
Magic in the Moonlight	31	39	Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he enlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley.
Magic in the Moonlight	32	39	Stanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them.
Magic in the Moonlight	33	39	In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who by then has recovered from her car accident, Stanley comes to the self-realization that he is in love with Sophie.
Magic in the Moonlight	34	39	He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead.
Magic in the Moonlight	35	39	Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable.
Magic in the Moonlight	36	39	She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice.
Magic in the Moonlight	37	39	Returning dejected to his aunt Vanessa's, Stanley is surprised when Sophie follows him there and he proposes.
Magic in the Moonlight	38	39	They kiss as the film ends.

Professional Sweetheart	0	29	Glory Eden (Ginger Rogers) is the "Purity Girl" of the Ippsie Wippsie Hour radio program.
Professional Sweetheart	1	29	The show's sponsor, Sam Ipswich (Gregory Ratoff), discovered the orphan and made her a star in three months.
Professional Sweetheart	2	29	He needs her public image to match her pure radio persona to promote Ippsie Wippsie, "the washcloth of queens".
Professional Sweetheart	3	29	However, Glory longs to be a party girl, going out to nightclubs, drinking, dancing, meeting men and having a good time.
Professional Sweetheart	4	29	All she can do is listen with envy to what her African-American maid Vera (Theresa Harris) does in Harlem after work.
Professional Sweetheart	5	29	Ipswich is anxious for her to sign a new contract, but she throws a tantrum and refuses, as it explicitly prohibits all the things she wants to do.
Professional Sweetheart	6	29	Along with everything else she has missed out on, she wants a sweetheart.
Professional Sweetheart	7	29	Speed Dennis (Frank McHugh), Ipswich's press agent, considers this a great idea.

Professional Sweetheart	12	29	Speed goes to Kentucky and persuades the reluctant rural hick to accept a ten-day stay in New York.
Professional Sweetheart	13	29	When he arrives, the press expects him to marry her, so Speed prompts the bashful Jim into romancing Glory.

Professional Sweetheart	17	29	Naive, Jim is stunned when he finds out that O'Connor is doing all this just to get Glory to sign with Kelsey and that the marriage is just a publicity stunt.
Professional Sweetheart	18	29	At first, Jim insists that Glory wants to retire from show business and settle down, but when she learns the Kelsey contract has no restrictions on how she lives her life, she is eager to sign.
Professional Sweetheart	19	29	Jim decides to take matters into his own hands, taking his wife home to rural Kentucky.
Professional Sweetheart	20	29	At first, Glory is miffed, but the couple settle their differences (after a spanking and a punch to the jaw).
Professional Sweetheart	21	29	As they are settling into country life, Speed arrives, but is unable to persuade Glory to return.
Professional Sweetheart	22	29	He comes up with an idea.
Professional Sweetheart	23	29	He gets Ipswich to let Vera sing as the Purity Girl that night.
Professional Sweetheart	24	29	His plan backfires.
Professional Sweetheart	25	29	Glory does become jealous, as he intended, but O'Connor is present, and she signs his contract.
Professional Sweetheart	26	29	When the couple go to New York, Jim refuses to let his wife perform without him.
Professional Sweetheart	27	29	Speed has hired him for Ippsie Wippsie as a poet.
Professional Sweetheart	28	29	To solve the problem, the two sponsors join forces, merging their companies to form Ippsie-Kelsey Clothies, and have the young couple perform together.
