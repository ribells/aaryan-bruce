Four Weddings and a Funeral

The film follows the adventures of a group of friends through the eyes of Charles, a good-natured but socially awkward man living in London, who becomes smitten with Carrie, an American whom Charles keeps meeting at four weddings and a funeral.
The first wedding is that of Angus and Laura, at which Charles is the best man.
Charles and his single friends wonder whether they will ever get married.
Charles meets Carrie and spends the night with her.
Carrie pretends that, now they have slept together, they will have to get married, to which Charles endeavours to respond before realising she is joking.
Carrie observes that they may have missed an opportunity and then returns to America.
The second wedding is that of Bernard and Lydia, a couple who became romantically involved at the previous wedding.
Charles encounters Carrie again, but she introduces him to her fiancé, Sir Hamish Banks, a wealthy politician.
At the reception, Charles finds himself seated with several ex-girlfriends who relate embarrassing stories about his inability to be discreet and afterwards bumps into Henrietta, known among Charles' friends as "Duckface", with whom he had a particularly difficult relationship.
Charles retreats to an empty hotel suite, seeing Carrie and Hamish leave in a taxicab, only to be trapped in a cupboard after the newlyweds stumble into the room to have sex.
After Charles awkwardly exits the room, Henrietta confronts him about his habit of "serial monogamy", telling him he is afraid of letting anyone get too close to him.
Charles then runs into Carrie, and they end up spending another night together.
A month later, Charles receives an invitation to Carrie's wedding.
While shopping for a present, he coincidentally encounters Carrie and ends up helping her select her wedding dress.
Carrie lists her more than thirty sexual partners.
Charles later awkwardly tries confessing his love to her and hinting that he would like to have a relationship with her, to no avail.
The third wedding is that of Carrie and Hamish.
Charles attends, depressed at the prospect of Carrie marrying Hamish.
At the reception, Gareth instructs his friends to seek potential mates; Fiona's brother, Tom, stumbles through an attempt to connect with a woman until she reveals that she is the minister's wife, while Charles's flatmate, Scarlett, strikes up a conversation with an American named Chester.
As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance, Fiona deduces his feelings about Carrie.
When Charles asks why Fiona is not married, she confesses that she has loved Charles since they first met years earlier.
Charles is appreciative and empathetic but does not requite her love.
During the groom's toast, Gareth dies of a heart attack.
At Gareth's funeral, his partner Matthew recites the poem "Funeral Blues" by Auden, commemorating his relationship with Gareth.
Charles and Tom discuss whether hoping to find your "one true love" is just a futile effort and ponder that, while their clique have always viewed themselves as proud to be single, Gareth and Matthew were a "married" couple all the while.
The fourth wedding is ten months later.
Charles has decided to marry Henrietta.
However, shortly before the ceremony, Carrie arrives, revealing to Charles that she and Hamish are separated.
Charles has a crisis of confidence, which he reveals to his deaf brother David and Matthew.
When the vicar asks whether anyone knows a reason why the couple should not marry, David, who was reading the vicar's lips, asks Charles to translate for him, and says in sign language that he suspects the groom loves someone else.
The vicar asks whether Charles does love someone else, and Charles replies, "I do".
Henrietta punches Charles and the wedding is halted.
Carrie visits Charles to apologise for attending the wedding.
Charles confesses that, while standing at the altar, he realised that for the first time in his life he totally and utterly loved one person, "and it wasn't the person standing next to me in the veil".
Charles makes a proposal of lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie, who accepts.
Henrietta marries an officer in the Grenadier Guards; David marries his girlfriend Serena; Scarlett marries Chester; Tom marries his distant cousin Deirdre (whom he met, for the second time in 25 years, at Charles's wedding); Matthew finds a new partner; Fiona marries Prince Charles; and Charles and Carrie have a young son.

Harold and Maude

Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) is a young man obsessed with death.
He stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his socialite mother (Vivian Pickles).
At another stranger's funeral service, Harold meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman who shares Harold's hobby of attending funerals.
He is entranced by her quirky outlook on life, which is bright and excessively carefree in contrast with his morbidity.
The pair form a bond and Maude slowly shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play banjo), and teaches him how to "[make] the most of his time on earth".
Meanwhile, Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to find him a wife.
One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed dates, by appearing to commit gruesome acts such as self-immolation, self-mutilation and seppuku.
As they become closer, their friendship soon blossoms into a romance and Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, psychiatrist, and priest.
Maude's 80th birthday arrives and Harold throws a surprise party for her.
As the couple dance, Maude tells Harold that she "couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell".
Confused, he questions Maude as to her meaning and she reveals that she has taken an overdose of sleeping pills and will be dead by morning.
She restates her firm belief that eighty is the proper age to die.
Harold rushes Maude to the hospital, where she is treated unsuccessfully and dies.
In the final sequence, Harold's car is seen going off a seaside cliff but after the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo.
After gazing down at the wreckage, he dances away, picking out on his banjo Cat Stevens' "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out".

My Fair Lady

ainy night in Edwardian London, opera patrons are waiting under the arches of Covent Garden for cabs.
Eliza Doolittle, a Cockney flower girl, runs into a young man called Freddy.
She admonishes him for spilling her bunches of violets in the mud, but she cheers up after selling one to an older gentleman.
She then flies into an angry outburst when a man copying down her speech is pointed out to her.
The man explains that he studies phonetics and can identify anyone's origin by their accent.
He laments Eliza's dreadful speech, asking why so many English people don't speak properly and explaining his theory that this is what truly separates social classes, rather than looks or money ("Why Can't the English.
").
He declares that in six months he could turn Eliza into a lady by teaching her to speak properly.
The older gentleman introduces himself as Colonel Pickering, a linguist who has studied Indian dialects.
The phoneticist introduces himself as Henry Higgins, and, as they both have always wanted to meet each other, Higgins invites Pickering to stay at his home in London.
He distractedly throws his change into Eliza's basket, and she and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable, proper life ("Wouldn't It Be Loverly.
").
Plot.
Eliza's father, Alfred Doolittle, and his drinking companions, Harry and Jamie, all dustmen, stop by the next morning.
He is searching for money for a drink, and Eliza shares her profits with him ("With a Little Bit of Luck").
Pickering and Higgins are discussing vowels at Higgins's home when mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, informs Higgins that a young woman with a ghastly accent has come to see him.
It is Eliza, who has come to take speech lessons so she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop.
Pickering wagers that Higgins cannot make good on his claim and volunteers to pay for Eliza's lessons.
An intensive makeover of Eliza's speech, manners and dress begins in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball.
Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted, patient man who cannot get along with women ("I'm an Ordinary Man").
To others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic.
Alfred Doolittle is informed that his daughter has been taken in by Professor Higgins, and considers that he might be able to make a little money from the situation ("With a Little Bit of Luck" [Reprise]).
Doolittle arrives at Higgins's house the next morning, claiming that Higgins is compromising Eliza's virtue.
Higgins is impressed by the man's natural gift for language and brazen lack of moral values.
He and Doolittle agree that Eliza can continue to take lessons and live at Higgins's house if Higgins gives Doolittle five pounds for a spree.
Higgins flippantly recommends Doolittle to an American millionaire who has written to Higgins seeking a lecturer on moral values.
Meanwhile, Eliza endures speech tutoring, endlessly repeating phrases like "In Hertford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen” (initially, the only "h" she aspirates is in "hever") and "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" (to practice the "long a" phoneme).
Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill Higgins, from sickness to drowning to a firing squad ("Just You Wait").
The servants lament the hard "work" Higgins does ("The Servants' Chorus").
Just as they give up, Eliza suddenly recites "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" in perfect upper-class style.
Higgins, Eliza, and Pickering happily dance around Higgins's study ("The Rain in Spain").
Thereafter she speaks with impeccable received pronunciation.
mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed; she declares she is too excited to sleep ("I Could Have Danced All Night").
For her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at Ascot Racecourse ("Ascot Gavotte").
Henry's mother reluctantly agrees to help Eliza make conversation, following Henry's advice that Eliza should stick to two subjects: the weather and everybody's health.
Eliza makes a good impression at first with her polite manners but later shocks everyone with her vulgar Cockney attitudes and slang.
She does, however, capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill, the young man she ran into in the opening scene.
Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, but she refuses to see him.
He declares that he will wait for her as long as necessary in the street outside Higgins's house ("On the Street Where You Live").
Eliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball, and after weeks of preparation, she is ready.
All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with her son, the prince ("Embassy Waltz").
Eliza then dances with Higgins.
A rival and former student of Higgins, a Hungarian phonetician named Zoltan Karpathy, is employed by the hostess to discover Eliza's origins through her speech.
Though Pickering and his mother caution him not to, Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.
The event is revealed to have been a success, with Zoltan Karpathy having concluded that Eliza is "not only Hungarian, but of royal blood.
She is a princess.
" After the ball, Pickering flatters Higgins on his triumph, and Higgins expresses his pleasure that the experiment is now over ("You Did It").
The episode leaves Eliza feeling used and abandoned.
Higgins completely ignores Eliza until he mislays his slippers.
He asks her where they are, and she lashes out at him, leaving the clueless professor mystified by her ingratitude.
When Eliza decides to leave Higgins, he insults her in frustration and storms off.
Eliza cries as she prepares to leave ("Just You Wait" [Reprise]).
She finds Freddy still waiting outside ("On the Street Where You Live" [Reprise]).
He begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she cuts him off, telling him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it ("Show Me").
She and Freddy return to Covent Garden, where her friends do not recognize her with her newly refined bearing ("The Flower Market/Wouldn't It Be Loverly.
" [Reprise]).
By chance, her father is there as well, dressed in a fine suit.
He explains that he received a surprise bequest of four thousand pounds a year from the American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry Eliza's "stepmother", the woman he has been living with for many years.
Eliza sees that she no longer belongs in Covent Garden, and she and Freddy depart.
Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding ("Get Me to the Church on Time").
Higgins awakens the next morning to find that, without Eliza, he has tea instead of coffee, and cannot find his own files.
He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women ("A Hymn to Him").
Pickering, becoming annoyed with Higgins, leaves to stay with his friend at the Home Office.
Higgins seeks his mother's advice and finds Eliza having tea with her.
Higgins's mother leaves Higgins and Eliza together.
Eliza explains that Higgins has always treated her as a flower girl, but she learned to be a lady because Pickering treated her as one.
Higgins claims he treated her the same way that Pickering did because both Higgins and Pickering treat all women alike.
Eliza accuses him of wanting her only to fetch and carry for him, saying that she will marry Freddy because he loves her.
She declares she no longer needs Higgins, saying she was foolish to think she did ("Without You").
Higgins is struck by Eliza's spirit and independence and wants her to stay with him, but she tells him that he will not see her again.
As Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza ("I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face").
He cannot bring himself to confess that he loves her, and insists to himself that if she marries Freddy and then comes back to him, he will not accept her.
But he finds it difficult to imagine being alone again.
He reviews the recording he made of the morning Eliza first came to him for lessons.
He hears his own harsh words: "She's so deliciously low.
So horribly dirty.
" Then the phonograph turns off, and a real voice speaks in a Cockney accent: "I washed me face an' 'ands before I come, I did".
It is Eliza, standing in the doorway, tentatively returning to him.
The musical ends on an ambiguous moment of possible reconciliation between teacher and pupil, as Higgins slouches and asks, "Eliza, where the devil are my slippers.
".

Pride and Prejudice

The novel opens with Mrs Bennet trying to persuade Mr Bennet to visit an eligible bachelor, Mr Bingley, who has arrived in the neighborhood.
After some verbal sparring with Mr Bennet baiting his wife, it transpires that this visit has taken place at Netherfield (Mr Bingley's rented house).
The visit is followed by an invitation to a ball at the local assembly rooms that the whole neighborhood will attend.
At the ball, Mr Bingley is open and cheerful, popular with all the guests, and appears to be very attracted to the beautiful Miss Bennet.
His friend, Mr Darcy, is reputed to be twice as wealthy; however, he is haughty and aloof.
He declines to dance with Elizabeth suggesting that she is not pretty enough to tempt him.
She finds this amusing and jokes about the statement with her friends.
Miss Jane Bennet also attracts the attention of Mr Bingley's sister Caroline, who invites her to visit.
Jane visits Miss Bingley and is caught in a rain shower on the way, catching a serious cold.
Elizabeth, out of genuine concern for her sister's well being, visits her sister there.
This is the point at which Darcy begins to see the attraction of Elizabeth, and Miss Bingley is shown to be jealous of Elizabeth since she wants to marry Darcy herself.
Mr Collins, a cousin of Mr Bennet and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family.
He is a pompous and obsequious clergyman because he expects each of the Bennet girls to wish to marry him due to his inheritance.
He plans to propose to Elizabeth over Jane as he is led to believe Jane is taken.
Elizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming Mr Wickham who singles out Elizabeth and tells her a story of the hardship that Mr Darcy has caused him by depriving him of a living (position as clergyman in a prosperous parish with good revenue that once granted, is for life) promised to him by Mr Darcy's late father.
Elizabeth's dislike of Mr Darcy is confirmed.
At a ball at which Mr Wickham is not present, Elizabeth dances with Mr Darcy rather against her will.
Other than Jane and Elizabeth, all the members of the Bennet family show their lack of decorum.
Mrs Bennet states loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged and each member of the family exposes the whole to ridicule.
The following morning, Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth.
She rejects him to the fury of her mother and the relief of her father.
They receive news that the Bingleys are leaving for London, and that Mr Collins has proposed to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible lady and Elizabeth's friend.
She is slightly older and is grateful to receive a proposal that will guarantee her a home.
Elizabeth is aghast at such pragmatism in matters of love.
Jane goes to visit her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner at an unfashionable address in London.
Miss Bingley clearly does not want to continue the friendship and Jane is upset though very composed.
In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr Collins in Kent.
Elizabeth and her hosts are frequently invited to Rosings Park, the imposing home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
Lady Catherine is Mr Darcy's aunt and extremely wealthy.
She expects Mr Darcy to marry her daughter.
Mr Darcy and his cousin, Colonel FitzWilliam, visit Lady Catherine.
Colonel FitzWilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr Darcy managed to save a friend from a bad match by convincing the friend of the lady's indifference.
Elizabeth is horrified at Darcy's involvement in an affair which has caused her sister so much pain.
Mr Darcy, however, has fallen in love with Elizabeth and proposes to her.
She rejects him, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness, and accuses him of treating Mr Wickham unjustly.
Mr Darcy accuses her family of wanting propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself.
Both are furious and they part barely speaking.
The following morning, Mr Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter that explains that his treatment of Mr Wickham was caused by the fact that Mr Wickham refused the Living and was compensated economically, but then proceeded to waste all the money and then, impoverished, demanded the Living again with threats.
After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister Georgiana for her great dowry, as Colonel FitzWilliam could also attest.
He also claimed that he believed that Miss Bennet who, despite her amiability, is actually a bit reserved, did not love Mr Bingley.
Darcy apologises for hurting Jane and Elizabeth begins to rejudge Mr Darcy on a clearer basis.
Some months later, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner visit Darcy's estate in Derbyshire, Pemberley.
While there Elizabeth hears an account of him from the housekeeper as being kind and generous.
When Mr Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is overwhelmingly kind and civil and invites Elizabeth and the Gardiner's to meet his sister and go fishing.
Elizabeth is surprised and delighted by the kindness to herself and her aunt and uncle.
However, she suddenly has news from Longbourne that her sister Lydia had eloped with Mr Wickham.
She tells Mr Darcy immediately and departs in haste, believing she will never see him again as Lydia's disgrace would ruin the family's good name.
After an agonizing wait, Mr Wickham is persuaded to marry Lydia with only the payment of debts required.
With some degree of decency restored, Lydia visits Elizabeth and tells her that Mr Darcy was at the wedding.
Mrs Gardiner informs Elizabeth that it is Mr Darcy who has made the match and hints that he may have a motive for doing so.
At this point, Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy return to Netherfield.
Bingley proposes to Jane and is accepted, much to the delight of all.
Lady Catherine visits Elizabeth under the impression that she is going to marry Mr Darcy, Elizabeth refuses to deny this claim and Lady Catherine leaves outraged by her perceived insolence.
Darcy and Elizabeth go for a walk together and they become engaged.
Elizabeth then has to convince her father that she is not marrying for money, and it is only after she speaks about Mr Darcy's true worth that he is happy about the wedding.

Forrest is raised by a single mother (Sally Field) who runs a bed and breakfast for travelling folk including at one point a young Elvis Presley, and has to wear leg braces to fix a crooked back.
Despite having a diminished intellect, Forrest is admitted to public school after his mother agrees to have sex with the principal.
On his first day of school, Forrest meets Jenny Curran, a girl his age who becomes his best friend and is a victim of child molestation by her father.
The children bond, finding in each other a confidante and kindred spirit.
With Jenny's encouragement, Forrest runs away from a group of bullies, struggling until his leg braces break off and he finds that he is able to run very fast.
Years later, while fleeing the same group of bullies, he runs onto a football field during a practice observed by legendary coach Paul "Bear" Bryant, which gets him into the University of Alabama on a football scholarship.
He features in the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door and listens to George Wallace.
He then meets President John Kennedy as a member of the NCAA "All-American" team.

Going My Way

Father Charles “Chuck” O’Malley (Bing Crosby), an incoming priest from East st Louis, arrives in New York City with an unconventional style that will transform the parish life of st Dominic’s Church.
On his first day, O'Malley gets into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald).
The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O’Malley’s recreational habits&nbsp;– particularly his golf-playing&nbsp;– and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O’Dowd (Frank McHugh).
In a discussion between O'Malley and O'Dowd without Fitzgibbon present, it is revealed that O’Malley was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor.
To spare Fitzgibbon’s feelings, the older pastor is kept unaware of this arrangement and believes that O’Malley is simply his assistant.
A series of events highlights the difference between O’Malley and Fitzgibbon’s styles, as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James (Jean Heather) having run away from home.
The most consequential difference of opinion between O’Malley and Fitzgibbon arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi (Stanley Clements).
Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance.
O’Malley seeks to make inroads into the boys’ lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir.
The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who finally decides to go to the bishop and ask for O’Malley to be transferred away.
In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop’s intention to put O’Malley in charge of the parish.
To avoid an uncomfortable situation, instead of making his initial request, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O’Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate of losing control over the church, he informs O’Malley of his new role.
A distressed Fitzgibbon then runs away, leading to a search.
He returns late at night, and as O’Malley puts the older priest to bed, the two begin to bond.
They discuss Fitzgibbon’s long-put-off desire to go to Ireland and see his mother, whom he's not seen since he left Ireland as a young priest to come to America, and who is now over 90.
O’Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, “Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral”.
Jenny Tuffel (now Genevieve Linden) (Risë Stevens), an old girlfriend of O'Malley's whom he left to join the priesthood, now has a successful acting and singing career.
O'Malley and Jenny discuss their past, and she performs a number from her starring role as Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera.
O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr.
(James Brown), the son of the church's mortgage-holder, Ted Haines Sr.
(Gene Lockhart).
On this visit, O’Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to “go his way,” which to him means to follow after the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same.
He performs for them the song “Going My Way,” which he wrote on this theme.
Jenny visits O’Malley at the church, sees the boys’ choir, and reads the sheet music of “Going My Way.
” She, O'Malley, and Father O’Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, perform “Going My Way” with the choir and a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, thereby saving the church from its financial woes.
The plan fails, as the music executive (William Frawley) brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell.
The choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings another song, "Swinging on a Star".
The executive overhears the song and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.
With the church affairs in order, O’Malley and Fitzgibbon go on a golf course together.
Just as everything seems to have fallen into place, though, the parish church is damaged in a massive fire.
O'Malley prepares to move on to a new assignment from the bishop.
He leaves O’Dowd to be Fitzgibbon’s new assistant, putting Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir.
On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a service that also serves as O'Malley's farewell.
As a going-away present, O’Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon’s mother from Ireland.
As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings “Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral”, as Father O’Malley quietly slips away into the night.

A Midsummer Night's Dream

The play consists of four interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazon queen, Hippolyta, which is set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of Fairyland, under the light of the moon.
The play opens with Hermia, who is in love with Lysander, resistant to her father Egeus' demand that she wed Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry.
Helena meanwhile pines unrequitedly for Demetrius.
Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian law before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter must marry the suitor chosen by her father, or else face death.
Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity while worshipping the goddess Artemis as a nun.
Peter Quince and his fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout, and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, "the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe".
Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them to the players.
Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time.
He would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles.
Bottom is told by Quince that he would do the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and ladies enough for the Duke and Lords to have the players hanged.
Quince ends the meeting with "at the Duke's oak we meet".
In a parallel plot line, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens.
Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding.
Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his "knight" or "henchman", since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers.
Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience.
He calls upon Robin "Puck" Goodfellow, his "shrewd and knavish sprite", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called "love-in-idleness", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow.
When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive.
He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy.
He says, "And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me".
Hermia and Lysander have escaped to the same forest in hopes of eloping.
Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander.
Helena continually makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia.
However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her.
Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.
Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander.
Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep.
Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena.
Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged.
When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes.
Upon waking up, he sees Helena.
Now, both men are in pursuit of Helena.
However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally.
Hermia is at a loss to see why her lover has abandoned her, and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her.
The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater.
Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.
Meanwhile, Quince and his band of six labourers ("rude mechanicals", as they are described by Puck) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus' wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's bower, for their rehearsal.
Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey.
When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion.
Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself.
Titania, having received the love-potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him.
She lavishes him with the attention of her and her fairies, and while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling.
Having achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania, orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom, and arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken.
Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart.
Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade.
Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the love potion to Lysander again, claiming all will be well in the morning.
The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt.
They wake the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding.
The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream.
After they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream "past the wit of man".
In Athens, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform Pyramus and Thisbe.
The performers are so terrible playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed.
Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune.
After all the other characters leave, Puck "restores amends" and suggests to the audience that what they just experienced might be nothing more than a dream.

The Apartment

Calvin Clifford (C) "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in New York City.
In order to climb the corporate ladder, Bud allows four company managers, who reinforce their position over him by regularly calling him "Buddy Boy," to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that he is a playboy bringing home different women every night.
The four managers (Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, and David White) write glowing reports about Bud, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).
Sheldrake calls Baxter to his office but says that he has found out why they were so enthusiastic.
Then he goes on to promote him in return for exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment.
He insists on using it that same night and, as compensation for such short notice, gives Baxter two company-sponsored tickets to the hit Broadway musical The Music Man.
After work, Bud catches Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), an elevator operator on whom he has had his eye, and asks her to go to the musical with him.
They agree to meet at the theater after she has a drink with a former fling.
The man whom she meets, by coincidence, is Sheldrake, who convinces her that he is about to divorce his wife for her.
They go to Baxter's apartment as Baxter waits forlornly outside the theater.
Several weeks later, at the company's raucous Christmas party, Sheldrake's secretary Miss Olsen (Edie Adams), drunkenly reveals to Fran that Fran is just the latest in a string of female employees whom Sheldrake has seduced into affairs with the promise of divorcing his wife, with Miss Olsen herself being one of them.
At Bud's apartment, Fran confronts Sheldrake, upset with herself for believing his lies.
Sheldrake maintains that he genuinely loves her but then leaves to return to his suburban family as usual.
Meanwhile, Bud accidentally finds out about Sheldrake and Fran.
Heartbroken, he lets himself be picked up by a woman (Hope Holiday) at a local bar.
When they arrive at his apartment, he is shocked to find Fran in his bed, fully clothed and unconscious from an intentional overdose of his sleeping pills.
He enlists the help of his neighbor, dr Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), to revive Fran without notifying the authorities and sends his confused bar pickup home.
To protect his job, he lets Dreyfuss believe that he and Fran are lovers who had fought, which he took so lightly that he was meeting another woman while she was attempting suicide.
This comes as no surprise to dr Dreyfuss or his wife, who long assumed Baxter was a womanizing playboy from all the noise coming from his apartment at all hours.
Fran spends two days recuperating at his apartment, while Bud tries entertaining and distracting her from any further suicidal thoughts, talking her into playing numerous hands of gin rummy.
Since she has been missing, Fran's brother-in-law Karl Matuschka (Johnny Seven) comes to the office looking for her.
She has not been there and neither has Baxter.
The previous day, one of the executives had seen Fran in the bedroom when he came to the apartment hoping to borrow it, and mentioned it to the other executives.
Resenting Bud for denying them access to his apartment, the executives direct the man there.
Baxter again takes responsibility for Fran's actions, and Karl punches him twice in the face.
Fran kisses Bud for not revealing her affair with Sheldrake to Karl, and Bud, sensing that she now cares for him, smiles and says the punch "didn't hurt a bit".
Sheldrake rewards Bud with a further promotion and fires Miss Olsen for telling Fran his history of womanizing.
However, Miss Olsen retaliates by telling his wife, who promptly throws him out.
Sheldrake moves into a room at his athletic club but now figures that he can string Fran along while he enjoys his newfound bachelorhood.
When Sheldrake asks Bud for the key to the apartment on New Year's Eve, Bud refuses and quits the firm.
That night at a party, an indignant Sheldrake tells Fran about Bud refusing to let Sheldrake use the apartment, especially for bringing Fran there, and then quitting.
Fran finally realizes that Baxter is the man who truly loves her.
Fran deserts Sheldrake at the party and runs to Bud's apartment.
Arriving at the door, she hears a loud noise like a gunshot.
Afraid that Bud has shot himself, Fran pounds on the door.
Bud, holding a bottle of overflowing champagne, finally opens the door, surprised and delighted that Fran is there.
Bud has been packing for a move to another job and city.
Fran insists on resuming their gin rummy game, telling Bud that she is now free as well.
When he declares his love for her, her reply is the now-famous final line of the film: "Shut up and deal", delivered with a loving and radiant smile.

The World According to Garp

The story deals with the life of Garp.
His mother, Jenny Fields, is a strong-willed nurse who wants a child but not a husband.
She encounters a dying ball turret gunner known only as Technical Sergeant Garp, who was severely brain damaged in combat.
Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual autonomic sexual arousal.
As a matter of practicality and kindness in making his passing as comfortable as possible and reducing his agitation, she manually gratifies him several times.
Unconstrained by convention and driven by practicality and her desire for a child, Jenny rapes Technical Sergeant Garp, and uses his semen to impregnate herself and names the resulting son "T".
(a name derived from "Technical Sergeant", but consisting of just initials).
Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position at the all-boys Steering School in New England.
Garp grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction&mdash;three topics in which his mother has little interest.
After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to Vienna, where he writes his first novella.
At the same time, his mother begins writing her autobiography, A Sexual Suspect.
After Jenny and Garp return to Steering, Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach's daughter, and begins his family—he a struggling writer, she a teacher of English.
The publication of A Sexual Suspect makes his mother famous.
She becomes a feminist icon, as feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man, and who chooses to raise a child on her own.
She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men, among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut off by her rapists to silence her.
The members of the group cut off their own tongues in support of the girl.
Garp becomes a devoted parent, wrestling with anxiety for the safety of his children and a desire to keep them safe from the dangers of the world.
He and his family inevitably experience dark and violent events through which the characters change and grow.
Garp learns (often painfully) from the women in his life (including transsexual ex-football player Roberta Muldoon), who are struggling to become more tolerant in the face of intolerance.
The story contains a great deal of (in the words of Garp's fictional teacher) "lunacy and sorrow", and the sometimes ridiculous chains of events the characters experience still resonate with painful truth.
The novel contains several framed narratives: Garp's first novella, The Pension Grillparzer; "Vigilance", a short story; and the first chapter of his novel, The World According to Bensenhaver.
The book also contains some motifs that appear in almost all John Irving novels: bears, New England, Vienna, wrestling, people who are uninterested in having sex, and a complex Dickensian plot that spans the protagonist's whole life.
Adultery (another common Irving motif) also plays a large part, culminating in one of the novel's most harrowing and memorable scenes.
Another familiar Irving trope, castration anxiety, is present, most obviously in the fate of one character, Michael Milton.

It Happened One Night

Spoiled heiress Ellen "Ellie" Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortune-hunter "King" Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander.
Alexander wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows that Westley is really only interested in her money.
Jumping ship in Florida, she runs away boarding a bus to New York City to reunite with her new spouse.
She meets fellow bus passenger Peter Warne, a freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter.
Soon Warne recognizes her and gives her a choice: If she will give him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reunite with Westley.
If not, he will tell her father where she is.
Ellie agrees to the first choice.
As they go through several adventures together, Ellie loses her initial disdain for him and begins to fall in love.
When they have to hitchhike, Peter fails to draw attention until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver.
When they stop en route, Danker tries to steal their luggage, but Peter seizes his car.
Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter.
When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they expel Ellie.
Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley.
Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but misses her on the road.
Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money, and agrees to have a second, formal wedding to Westley.
On her wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story.
When Peter comes to Ellie's home, mr Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses: a paltry $3960.
When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior, Peter admits he loves Ellie, and storms out.
Westley arrives for his wedding via autogyro but at the wedding ceremony, mr Andrews reveals Peter's refusal of the reward money to Ellie, sends her to Peter, and pays Westley off.

Coming to America

Akeem Joffer, the heir to the throne of Zamunda (a fictional African kingdom), lives a pampered lifestyle with every daily task performed by servants.
Akeem has become fed up with this and wishes to do more for himself.
The final straw comes when his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aeoleon, present him with an arranged bride-to-be named Imani Izzi, whom he has never met and who has been trained to obey Akeem's every command.
Akeem concocts a plan to travel to the United States to find an intelligent, independent-minded woman he can both love and respect, and who will love Akeem for who he is and not for his wealth and social status as a prince.
Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, flip a coin to decide between going to either Los Angeles or New York City, and end up going to New York City.
They end up in the borough of Queens and rent a run-down apartment in the neighborhood of Long Island City, passing themselves off as poor foreign students.
They begin working at a local fast food restaurant called McDowell's—an obvious ripoff of McDonald's—owned by widower Cleo McDowell and his two daughters, Lisa and Patrice.
Akeem soon falls in love with Lisa, who possesses all the qualities that the prince is looking for in a woman, as first seen by Akeem at a rally where she makes a strong plea to renovate a playground.
The rest of the film centers on Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's hand in marriage, which is complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks (Eriq La Salle), whose father owns "Soul Glo" (a Jheri curl–like hairstyling aid).
Lisa eventually breaks up with Darryl after he announces their engagement (without Lisa having given her consent) to their families, and starts dating Akeem.
Although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how commoners live, Semmi is not comfortable with living the life of a poor man.
When Akeem randomly donates their travel money to the homeless Randolph and Mortimer Duke (characters in the previous Eddie Murphy film Trading Places), Semmi transmits a plea to the King of Zamunda for financial help.
This causes Akeem's parents to travel to Queens and expose Akeem's identity as a prince to the McDowells.
mr McDowell, initially disapproving of the match as he did not want to see his daughter with a man of poor means, is ecstatic that she has in fact attracted the interest of an extremely wealthy prince, but Lisa becomes angry and confused as to why Akeem lied to her about his identity, as he had told her before that he was actually a Zamundan goat herder.
Still hurt and angry that Akeem lied to her, she refuses to marry him, even after he offers to renounce his throne, and he returns home with a broken heart, resigned to marry the woman chosen for him by his parents.
On the way to the airport, King Jaffe remarks that Akeem can't marry Lisa anyway because of "tradition," and tries defending himself by saying "Who am I to change it.
", with Queen Aeoleon curtly responding, "I thought you were the King.
At the final scene's wedding procession, Akeem, still heartbroken, waits dejectedly at the altar as his soon-to-be consort makes her way down the aisle.
However, when Akeem lifts the veil to kiss her, he finds Lisa instead of Imani.
Akeem and Lisa are married, and they ride happily in a carriage after the ceremony to the cheers of Zamundans.
Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her.
Akeem offers to formally abdicate if she doesn't want a life like this, but Lisa playfully declines and decides to become royalty instead.

She Done Him Wrong

The story is set in New York City in the 1890s.
A bawdy singer, Lady Lou (Mae West), works in the Bowery barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Gus Jordan (Noah Beery), who has given her many diamonds.
But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine.
What she does not know is that Gus trafficks in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds.
He also sends young women to San Francisco to be pickpockets.
Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita (Rafaela Ottiano) and Rita's lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff (Gilbert Roland).
One of Gus's rivals and former "friend" of Lou's, named Dan Flynn (David Landau), spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail.
Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him.
A city mission (a thinly disguised Salvation Army) is located next door to the bar.
Its young director, Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), is in reality an undercover Federal agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar.
Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers.
Lou's former boyfriend, Chick Clark (Owen Moore), is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her.
In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer.
Warned that Chick thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him.
All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly as she walks down the cellblock.
Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out.
She lies and claims she has been true to him.
Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend.
Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar.
He comes into Lou's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her.
Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number.
After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death.
Lou calmly combs the dead woman's long hair to hide the fact Rita is dead while the police search the room for Chick Clark.
She has her bodyguard Spider (Dewey Robinson), who "would do anything for you, Lou" dispose of Rita's body.
She then tells Spider to bring Chick, who's hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs.
Then, while she sings "Frankie and Johnny", she silently signals to Dan Flynn that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows Chick is in there with a gun.
Chick shoots Dan dead and the gunfire draws a police raid.
Cummings shows his badge and reveals himself as "The Hawk", a well-known Federal agent, as he arrests Gus and Sergei.
Chick, still lurking in Lou's room, is about to kill Lou for double-crossing him, when Cummings also apprehends him.
Cummings then takes Lou away in an open horse-drawn carriage instead of the paddywagon into which all the other criminals have been loaded.
He tells her she doesn't belong in jail and removes all her other rings and slips a diamond engagement ring onto her marriage finger.

It's a Wonderful Life

On Christmas Eve 1945, in Bedford Falls, New York, George Bailey is suicidal.
Prayers for him reach Heaven, where Clarence Odbody, Angel 2nd Class, is assigned to save George in order to earn his angel wings.
To prepare, Clarence is shown flashbacks of George's life.
The first is in 1919, when 12-year-old George saves his younger brother Harry, who falls through the ice on a frozen pond, from drowning; George loses his hearing in one ear as a result.
While working after school at the local drug store, George sees that his employer, mr Gower, distraught over his son's death from the flu, has accidentally added poison to a child's prescription drug, and intervenes to stop it from causing harm.
On Harry's graduation night in 1928, George talks to Mary Hatch, who has had a crush on him from an early age.
They are interrupted by news of his father's death.
George postpones his travel plans in order to sort out the family business, Bailey Brothers' Building and Loan, a longtime competitor to Henry Potter, the local banker and the richest man in town.
Potter wishes to dissolve the Building and Loan to take over its business.
George convinces the board of directors to vote against Potter.
They agree, on condition that George runs the business, along with his absent-minded uncle Billy.
George and Mary get married.
On their way to their honeymoon, they witness a run on the bank and use their honeymoon savings to lend financial support at the Building and Loan until the bank reopens.
Over time George establishes Bailey Park, a housing development with small houses financed by loans from Bailey Building and Loan, which allows people to own their own homes rather than pay rent to live in Potter's overpriced slums.
Potter, frustrated at losing control of the housing market, attempts to lure George into becoming his assistant; George is momentarily tempted, but rejects the offer.
During World War II, George is ineligible for service because of his bad ear.
Harry becomes a Navy pilot and shoots down a kamikaze plane that would have bombed an amphibious transport; he is awarded the Medal of Honor.
On Christmas Eve morning 1945, the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry.
Uncle Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 for the Building and Loan.
(The $8,000 was worth over $100,000 in 2017 dollars) He teases Potter, taking his newspaper and bragging about Harry being on the front page; the banker angrily grabs the newspaper, inside of which Billy has unintentionally tucked the envelope containing the money.
Upon seeing the money, Potter realizes the potential scandal could lead to the Building and Loan's downfall.
Potter hides the money, knowing its loss will cause severe financial problems for the Building and Loan.
When Uncle Billy cannot find the money, he and George frantically search for it.
When the bank examiner arrives to review their records, George berates his uncle for endangering the Building and Loan, goes home and takes out his frustration on his family.
He apologizes to his wife and children, then leaves.
George desperately appeals to Potter for a loan.
When George offers his life insurance policy as collateral, Potter says George is worth more dead than alive and phones the police to have him arrested.
George gets drunk at a local bar and is involved in a fight before he leaves and goes to a nearby bridge, thinking of suicide.
The film's narrative catches up to the time of the opening scene.
Before he can jump, Clarence dives into the river just before George does, causing George to rescue Clarence rather than killing himself.
George does not believe Clarence's subsequent claim to be his guardian angel.
When George says he wishes he had never been born, Clarence decides to grant his wish and show George an alternate timeline in which he never existed.
Bedford Falls is named Pottersville and is a less congenial place.
mr Gower has recently been released from prison for manslaughter, because George was not there to stop him from putting poison in the pills.
The Building and Loan has closed down, as George never took over after mr Bailey's passing.
George's mother does not recognize him; she reveals that Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the collapse of the Building and Loan.
In the cemetery where Bailey Park would have been, George discovers the grave of his brother.
Clarence tells him all the soldiers on the transport died, as Harry was never there to save them, because George had never saved Harry from drowning.
Mary never married; when George says he is her husband, she screams for the police, causing George to flee and the local policeman to give chase.
George, now convinced that Clarence is really his guardian angel, runs back to the bridge and begs for his life back; the alternate timeline changes back to the original reality.
George runs home to await his arrest.
Mary and Uncle Billy arrive, having rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to cover the missing $8,000 and for Potter's warrant to be torn up.
Harry arrives and toasts George.
A bell on the Christmas tree rings, and his daughter recalls a story that says the sound means that an angel has just earned his wings, signifying Clarence's promotion.

Seven Brides for Seven Brothers

In 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee comes into a town in the Oregon Territory to search for a bride.
Met with ridicule by some locals, he comes upon the local tavern where he meets Milly.
Convinced of her worth by the quality of her cooking and her insistence on finishing her chores before she would leave with him, he proposes and she accepts despite knowing each other for only a few hours.
On the journey home Milly talks about how she is excited to be cooking and taking care of only one man, visibly upsetting Adam.
When they arrive at his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is one of seven brothers living under the same roof.
The brothers have been named alphabetically from the Old Testament in order of birth: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for frankincense, the Old Testament having no names beginning with F), and Gideon.
All of the brothers have red hair and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall.
Milly teaches Adam's rowdy, ill-behaved younger brothers manners and social mores.
She also shows them how to dance.
At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their "mountain man" ways, but eventually each comes to see that the only way he will get a woman of his own is to do things Milly's way.
They try out their new manners at a barn-raising, where they meet six women they like — Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice.
The girls take a fancy to the brothers as well.
However, they already have suitors among the young men of the town, who jealously taunt the brothers into fighting during the barn-raising.
At first the six brothers remember Milly's teaching and try to resist being drawn into a fight by accepting physical indignities.
Adam refuses to let himself be pushed around by the rival suitors and calls his younger brothers cowards for letting them get away with their behavior.
The girls' suitors from the town finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking Gideon into fighting back.
A free-for-all ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker townie rivals.
Although the Pontipees did not start the fight, they are banished from the town after demolishing the barn they were raising in the course of the brawl.
Winter finds the six younger brothers pining for the girls for whom they had fallen fast and hard.
Milly asks Adam to talk to the brothers as she fears they will want to leave because of missing the girls.
Adam reads his brothers the story of "The Sobbin' Women" (taken from Plutarch's story of the Sabine Women), one of the books Milly brought to the homestead.
He tells them that they should stop moping around and take whatever action is necessary to get their women.
Aided by Adam, the brothers kidnap the six girls, then cause an avalanche in Echo Pass so that they cannot be followed by the townspeople.
The only problem: they forgot to bring the parson to perform the marriages.
Milly is furious with Adam, as are the six kidnapped women.
Milly consigns the brothers to the barn "with the rest of the livestock" while the women live in the house.
Adam, feeling betrayed by Milly's reaction, leaves for the trapping cabin farther up the mountain to live out the winter by himself, unknowingly hurting Milly's feelings.
Soon after, Milly realizes that she is pregnant by Adam.
The winter months slowly pass.
The women vent their frustration and resentment by playing pranks on the brothers, such as hitting them with rock-filled snowballs and dumping basins of wash water on them.
By spring, the women have forgiven their "kidnappers" and fallen in love with the brothers, who are now allowed to court them.
Milly gives birth to a daughter, Hannah.
Gideon rides to the cabin to inform Adam of his daughter's arrival and asks him to come home.
Adam refuses, saying that he had said he would return home only when the snow had melted enough that the pass was open to traffic.
Having time to think about his baby daughter, Adam returns home in the spring just as Echo Pass is opening and reconciles with Milly.
As a newly responsible father, he has become aware of how worried the townspeople would be about what has happened to the six abducted girls.
Adam realizes he was wrong to tell his brothers to kidnap them.
He tells his brothers they need to take the women back to their homes in town, but his brothers are unwilling.
The six women also do not want to return to their homes; they all want to stay at the farm with their new suitors and hide so they will not be taken back home.
When Milly discovers that the women are not in the house, Adam tells his brothers to go after them and bring them back.
The townspeople arrive with the intention of lynching the Pontipee brothers for the kidnappings.
Upon finding the brothers trying to force the women to return, the fathers believe their daughters are being assaulted and charge to their rescue.
Alice's father (Ian Wolfe), a preacher, hears baby Hannah cry in the distance, and worries that the baby might belong to one of the kidnapped girls.
The fathers and other townsmen round up the Pontipees and announce they intend to hang them.
Alice's father, the Reverend Alcott, asks the women whose baby he had heard.
They all decide, simultaneously, to claim the baby as their own.
This misinformation gives the women and the brothers their wish: the townspeople, including the girls' fathers, insist that all six couples marry at once in a shotgun wedding, performed by the parson while Adam and Milly watch and the fathers stand behind their daughters' grooms, shotguns over their arms.

Chasing Amy

Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends.
They meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) at a comic book convention in New York City, where they are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic.
Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is a lesbian.
The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops.
Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa.
She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.
This new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship.
Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname "Finger Cuffs".
Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with.
He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing.
During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her "many" youthful sexual experimentations.
She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with.
However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.
Later, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's.
Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her.
Angry at himself for letting her go, he has "spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak".
Moved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky.
He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend.
He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him—kissing him passionately to prove the point.
Holden suggests a threesome.
Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship.
Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his "whore".
Banky also leaves the apartment, instantly ending their friendship.
One year later, both Banky and Holden are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York.
It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back).
Banky smiles sadly at seeing his old friend, who silently congratulates him for his success on his own comic.
Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her.
He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of Chasing Amy, his new comic based on their failed relationship.
After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to.
A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa feigns indifference and replies, "Oh, just some guy I knew".

Mr. Deeds Goes to Town

During the Great Depression, Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper), the co-owner of a tallow works, part-time greeting card poet, and tuba-playing inhabitant of the (fictional) hamlet of Mandrake Falls, Vermont, inherits 20 million dollars from his late uncle, Martin Semple.
Semple's scheming attorney, John Cedar (Douglass Dumbrille), locates Deeds and takes him to New York City.
Cedar gives his cynical troubleshooter, ex-newspaperman Cornelius Cobb (Lionel Stander), the task of keeping reporters away from Deeds.
Cobb is outfoxed, however, by star reporter Louise "Babe" Bennett (Jean Arthur), who appeals to Deeds' romantic fantasy of rescuing a damsel in distress by masquerading as a poor worker named Mary Dawson.
She pretends to faint from exhaustion after "walking all day to find a job" and worms her way into his confidence.
Bennett proceeds to write a series of enormously popular articles mocking Longfellow's hick ways and odd behavior, giving him the nickname "Cinderella Man".
Cedar tries to get Deeds' power of attorney in order to keep his own financial misdeeds secret.
Deeds, however, proves to be a shrewd judge of character, easily fending off Cedar and other greedy opportunists.
He wins Cobb's wholehearted respect and eventually Babe's love.
She quits her job in shame, but before she can tell Deeds the truth about herself, Cobb finds it out and tells Deeds.
Deeds, who has been in love with her, is left heartbroken, and in disgust he decides to return to Mandrake Falls.
After he has packed and is about leave, a dispossessed farmer (John Wray) stomps into his mansion and threatens him with a gun.
He expresses his scorn for the seemingly heartless, ultra-rich man, who will not lift a finger to help the multitudes of desperate poor.
After the intruder comes to his senses, Deeds realizes what he can do with his troublesome fortune.
He decides to provide fully equipped 10-acre farms free to thousands of homeless families if they will work the land for three years.
Alarmed at the prospect of losing control of the fortune, Cedar joins forces with Deeds' only other relative (and the man's grasping, domineering wife) in seeking to have Deeds declared mentally incompetent.
Along with Babe's betrayal, this finally breaks Deeds' spirit and he sinks into a deep depression.
A sanity hearing is scheduled to determine who should control the Deeds' fortune.
During the hearing.
Cedar calls an expert who diagnoses manic depression based on Babe's articles and Deeds' current behavior; he gets Deeds' Mandrake Falls tenants, eccentric elderly sisters Jane and Amy Faulkner (Margaret Seddon and Margaret McWade), to testify that Deeds is "pixilated".
Deeds is too depressed to defend himself and the situation looks bleak when Babe finally speaks up passionately on his behalf, castigating herself for what she did to him.
When he realizes that she truly loves him, he begins speaking, systematically punching holes in Cedar's case—when he asks the Faulkners who else is pixilated, they reply, "Why everyone, but us"—before actually punching Cedar in the face.
In the end the judge declares him to be "the sanest man who ever walked into this courtroom".

The Awful Truth

Jerry Warriner (Cary Grant) returns home from a trip, which he falsely says was to Florida, to find that his wife, Lucy (Irene Dunne), is not at home.
When she returns in the company of her handsome music teacher, Armand Duvalle (Alexander D'Arcy), Jerry learns that Lucy spent the night in the country with Armand, after his car, they claim, broke down unexpectedly.
Lucy then discovers that Jerry did not actually go to Florida, though he went so far as to get an artificial tan and write multiple fake letters home to convince her that he did.
Mutual suspicions result in divorce.
During the divorce proceedings, Lucy moves into an apartment with her Aunt Patsy (Cecil Cunningham) and becomes engaged to a neighbor, Oklahoma native Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy), while Jerry is seen on a date with singer Dixie Belle Lee (Joyce Compton).
However, Leeson's mother (Esther Dale) does not approve of her.
Eventually, Lucy realizes that she still loves Jerry and decides to break off the engagement.
However, before she can inform Dan, Armand shows up at her apartment to discuss Jerry's earlier interruption of Lucy's singing recital.
When Jerry knocks on the door, Armand decides it would be prudent to hide in the bedroom.
Jerry wants to reconcile, much to Lucy's delight, but then Dan and his mother make an appearance.
Wanting to avoid complications, Jerry slips into Lucy's bedroom, too.
A fight erupts when he finds Armand already there.
When Jerry chases Armand out of the apartment in front of the Leesons, Dan and his mother stalk out.
Afterwards, Jerry is seen around town with heiress Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont).
To break up this relationship, on the night before the final divorce decree, Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion, pretending to be Jerry's sister.
She acts like a showgirl (recreating a risqué musical number she had seen performed by Dixie Belle) and lets on that Jerry's father ("their" father) had been a gardener at Princeton University, not a student athlete as Jerry had claimed.
Realizing that his chances with Barbara have been effectively sabotaged, Jerry drives Lucy away in her car.
Motorcycle policemen stop them on the road, and Lucy, plotting to spend more time with Jerry, wrecks the car.
The couple get a lift to her aunt's cabin from the policemen.
Once there, Jerry admits having made a fool of himself and the Warriners are happily reconciled, just before the clock strikes midnight.

Annie Hall

The comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) ended a year ago.
Growing up in New York, he vexed his mother with impossible questions about the emptiness of existence, but he was precocious about his innocent sexual curiosity.
Annie and Alvy, in a line for The Sorrow and the Pity, overhear another man deriding the work of Federico Fellini and Marshall McLuhan; McLuhan himself steps in at Alvy's invitation to criticize the man's comprehension.
That night, Annie shows no interest in sex with Alvy.
Instead, they discuss his first wife (Carol Kane), whose ardor gave him no pleasure.
His second marriage was to a New York writer who didn't like sports and was unable to reach orgasm.
With Annie, it is different.
The two of them have fun making a meal of boiled lobster together.
He teases her about the unusual men in her past.
He met her playing tennis doubles with friends.
Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then a glass of wine on her balcony.
There, what seemed a mild exchange of trivial personal data is revealed in "mental subtitles" as an escalating flirtation.
Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You").
He suggests they kiss first, to get it out of the way.
After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is "a wreck", while she relaxes with a joint.
Soon Annie admits she loves him, while he buys her books on death and says that his feelings for her are more than just love.
When she moves in with him, things become very tense.
Eventually, he finds her arm in arm with one of her college professors and the two begin to argue whether this is the "flexibility" they had discussed.
They eventually break up, and he searches for the truth of relationships, asking strangers on the street about the nature of love, questioning his formative years, until he casts himself in Snow White opposite Annie's Evil Queen.
Alvy returns to dating, but the effort is marred by neurosis, bad sex, and finally an interruption from Annie, who insists he come over immediately.
It turns out she needs him to kill a spider.
A reconciliation follows, coupled with a vow to stay together come what may.
However, their separate discussions with their therapists make it evident there is an unspoken divide.
When Alvy accepts an offer to present an award on television, they fly out to Los Angeles, with Alvy's friend, Rob (Tony Roberts).
However, on the return trip, they agree that their relationship is not working.
After losing her to her record producer, Tony Lacey (Paul Simon), he unsuccessfully tries rekindling the flame with a marriage proposal.
Back in New York, he stages a play of their relationship but changes the ending: now she accepts.
The last meeting for them is a wistful coda on New York's Upper West Side, when they have both moved on to someone new.
Alvy's voice returns with a summation: love is essential, especially if it is neurotic.
Annie sings "Seems Like Old Times" and the credits roll.

American Graffiti

In early September 1962 in Modesto, California, on the last evening of summer vacation, recent high school graduates and longtime friends, Curt Henderson and Steve Bolander, meet John Milner, the drag-racing king of the town, and Terry "The Toad" Fields in the parking lot of the local Mel's Drive-In diner.
Curt and Steve are scheduled to travel the next morning to Northeastern United States to start college.
Despite receiving a $2,000 scholarship from the local Moose Lodge, Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto.
Steve gives Toad his 1958 Chevrolet Impala to watch while he's away at college until he returns at Christmas.
Steve's girlfriend, Laurie, who is also Curt's sister, arrives in her car.
Steve suggests to Laurie, who is already glum about him going to college, that they see other people while he is away in order to "strengthen" their relationship.
Though not openly upset, she is displeased with his proposal which affects their interactions the rest of the evening.
Curt accompanies Steve, last year's high school student class president, and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the back-to-high-school sock hop.
In one story line, Curt is desperate to find a beautiful blonde girl driving a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird that he sees en route to the dance: at a stoplight, she appears to say "I love you" before disappearing around the corner.
After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle.
The Pharaohs tell Curt that "The Blonde" is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either.
Determined to get a message to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl.
Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar.
The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do.
As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself.
Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for "The Blonde" to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth.
Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing.
It turns out to be "The Blonde" who says she knows him and maybe she would see him cruising the coming night.
Curt replies probably not, intimating that he decided to go to college and will be leaving that morning.
Meanwhile The Toad, in Steve's car, and John, in his yellow 1932 Deuce Coupé hot rod, cruise the strip of Modesto.
Toad, who is normally socially inept with girls, successfully picks up a flirtatious, and somewhat rebellious, girl named Debbie.
John inadvertently picks up Carol, an annoying teenybopper who seems fond of him.
Another drag racer, the handsome and arrogant Bob Falfa, is searching out John in order to challenge him to a race.
Steve and Laurie have a series of arguments and make-ups through the evening.
They finally split and, as the story lines intertwine, Bob Falfa picks up Laurie in his black 1955 Chevrolet One-Fifty Coupé.
Bob finally finds John and goads him into racing.
A parade of cars follow them to "Paradise Road" to watch the race.
Laurie rides shotgun with Bob as Toad starts the race.
As Bob begins taking a lead in the race, he loses control of the car when a front tire blows, and the car plunges into a ditch and rolls over.
Steve and John leap out of their cars and rush to the wreck as a dazed Bob and Laurie stagger out of the car before it explodes.
Distraught, Laurie grips Steve tightly and begs him not to leave her.
He assures her that he will stay in Modesto.
At the airfield in the morning, Curt says goodbye to his parents, his sister Laurie, Steve, John and The Toad.
As the plane takes off, Curt, gazing out of the window, sees the white Ford Thunderbird belonging to the mysterious blonde driving down a country road.
An on-screen epilogue reveals that John was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964, Toad was reported missing in action near An Lộc in December 1965, Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto, California, and Curt is a writer living in Canada.

Harry Tasker leads a double life; while his wife Helen and daughter Dana believe him to be a run-of-the-mill computer salesman, he is actually a black operative for a covert counter-terrorism task force known as Omega Sector.
Harry and his partners Albert "Gib" Gibson and Faisal infiltrate a private function in Switzerland, where they learn of the existence of a Palestinian terrorist group known as the Crimson Jihad, led by Salim Abu Aziz.
Harry suspects that antiques dealer Juno Skinner has ties to Aziz, and visits her undercover as a corporate art consultant.
Though the initial investigation proves fruitless, Aziz correctly identifies Harry as a spy and tries to kill him.
Harry kills two of Aziz's men and pursues the leader through the streets of Washington,C, but loses him on a rooftop.
As a result, Harry misses the birthday party that Helen and Dana had arranged for him.
Harry heads to Helen's office the next day to surprise her for lunch, but overhears her talking on the phone to a man named Simon.
He uses Omega Sector resources to learn that Simon is a used car salesman, pretending to be a secret agent as a means to seduce Helen.
While masked, Harry and a team of agents kidnap Helen while she is at Simon's trailer and frighten the latter into staying away from her.
Using a voice masking device, Harry interrogates Helen and learns that, due to his constant absence, she is desperately seeking adventure.
Harry thus arranges for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure in his hotel room and plant a bug on his phone.
The figure turns out to be Harry, who hopes to surprise Helen.
However, things take a turn for the worse when Aziz's men burst in, kidnap the couple, and take them to an island in the Florida Keys.
Aziz reveals he has smuggled stolen nuclear warheads into the country via antique statues shipped by Juno, and threatens to detonate them in majorS.
cities unless theS.
military withdraws from the Persian Gulf.
He then orders the couple to be tortured; Harry (under a truth serum) reveals his double life to an understandably shocked Helen.
The couple stage an escape, Harry fighting off Aziz's men with an improvised flamethrower.
Aziz preps one of the warheads to detonate in ninety minutes, and loads the rest onto trucks to be taken elsewhere.
During the ensuing chaos, Helen is captured by Juno and taken with the convoy on the Overseas Highway.
Having tracked Harry via Helen's tracker, he is rescued by agents led by Gib and together they begin pursuit the convoy, sending two Harrier Jump Jets.
The jets destroy part of the bridge to cut off the trucks' escape route, and Harry rescues Helen from Juno's limo before it careens into the ocean below.
Upon safely returning to the mainland, they learn that Aziz and his men have taken control of a Miami skyscraper via helicopter and have kidnapped Dana, threatening to detonate the remaining bomb.
Harry commandeers one of the jets to rescue his daughter.
Faisal poses as part of a news team requested by Aziz, providing enough distraction for Dana to steal the ignition key and flee the room.
Aziz chases Dana onto a tower crane when Harry arrives.
Harry is able to rescue Dana while he and Aziz struggle in the cockpit.
Aziz becomes ensnared on the end of one of the plane's missiles, which Harry fires at the passing terrorist helicopter — destroying it and the remaining bomb on board.
Harry, Helen, and Dana are then safely reunited.
A year later, the Tasker's family integrity has been restored, and it is revealed that Helen has become another Omega Sector agent.
Harry and Helen are called to embark on a new mission together at a formal party, where they encounter Simon attempting to seduce one of the female guests.
Helen and Harry intimidate Simon into fleeing, and the film ends with the couple dancing the tango (as Harry and Juno did at the beginning of the film) in celebration while Gib complains about always being stuck in the surveillance van.

Bridget Jones's Diary

Bridget not only obsesses about her love life, but also details her various daily struggles with her weight, her over-indulgence in alcohol and cigarettes, and her career.
Bridget's friends and family are the supporting characters in her diary.
These friends are there for her unconditionally throughout the novel; they give her advice about her relationships, and support when problems arise.
Her friends are essentially her surrogate family in London.
Bridget's parents live outside of the city, and while they play a lesser role than her friends, they are important figures in Bridget's life.
Her mother is an overconfident, doting woman who is constantly trying to marry Bridget off to a rich, handsome man; and her father is considerably more down-to-earth, though he is sometimes driven into uncharacteristically unstable states of mind by his wife.
Bridget often visits her parents, as well as her parents' friends, primarily Geoffrey and Una Alconbury; Geoffrey creates a mildly uncomfortable situation for Bridget by insisting she call him "Uncle Geoffrey" despite his propensity for groping her rear end whenever they meet.
In these situations, Bridget is often plagued with that perennial question "How's your love life.
" and exposed to the eccentricities of middle class British society, manifested in turkey curry buffets and tarts and vicars parties at which the women wear sexually provocative ("tart") costumes, while the men dress as Anglican priests ("vicars").
The novel is based on Pride and Prejudice.

The Quiet Man

In the 1920s, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), an Irish-born American from Pittsburgh, travels to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm and his birthplace in Inisfree.
He meets and falls in love with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), the sister of the bullying, loud-mouthed landowner Squire "Red" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen).
Danaher, who had wanted the farm himself, is angry that the Widow Tillane (herself angered by Danaher's admission that he had discussed her in the local pub) accepts Sean's bid, and retaliates by refusing consent for his sister to marry.
Several town locals, including the Catholic priest, Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), conspire to trick him into believing that the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) wants to marry him, but only if Mary Kate is no longer living in his house.
After learning the truth on Sean and Mary Kate's wedding day, an enraged Will refuses to give his sister her dowry which is made up of a large sum of money and her family possessions passed down from her mother.
Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, cares nothing about the dowry, but to Mary Kate the dowry represents her independence, identity, and pride.
She feels passionately and intensely that the dowry is hers and is needed to validate her marriage to Sean.
Angered and shamed by Sean's refusal to confront her brother and demand what is legally hers, she brands him a coward, and, despite living together, they are quickly estranged as husband and wife.
In the morning they find that others in the village had visited Will and pressured him to return Mary Kate's furniture, but not her money.
Sean had been a boxer in the United States, a heavyweight challenger known as "Trooper Thorn".
After accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, Sean hung up his gloves, vowing never to fight again.
This is known to only one person in the village, the Church of Ireland minister, the Rev.
Playfair (Arthur Shields), who once upon a time had been the lightweight champion and so understands Thornton's internal conflict over the fight.
In an attempt to force Sean to confront Will, Mary Kate leaves him and boards a train departing Castletown and headed to Dublin.
Sean hears that she left for the station and drags her off the train.
Followed by the crowding townspeople, he forces her to walk with him the five miles back to Inisfree and directly to the Danaher farm.
Sean demands that Will hand over her dowry.
When Will refuses, he throws Mary Kate back at Will, saying that "no dowry, no marriage" is their custom not his, shocking the two and shaming Will into finally paying the monetary part of his sister's dowry.
Sean promptly throws the money into a nearby furnace which Mary Kate holds open, showing that Mary Kate never cared about the money, but only what it represented.
After a proud Mary Kate announces so all can hear, that she will now return home to prepare his supper, and departs, Will punches Sean, and a long, memorable fistfight ensues between the two, drawing crowds from miles around.
They slug it out through the village, stop for a drink, brawl again, then, somewhat drunk, admit grudging mutual respect and the two return to Sean and Mary Kate's home for supper, where it is implied the rift is healed.
Sean regains Mary Kate's love and respect.
In the aftermath it is shown that Will and the Widow Tillane begin courting, and "peace is returned to Inisfree".

Guess Who's Coming to Dinner

Joanna Drayton's (Katharine Houghton) unannounced early return from a Hawaiian vacation causes a stir when she brings her new fiancé to her childhood upper-class home in San Francisco.
He is John Prentice (Sidney Poitier): a widowed, black physician.
Joanna's parents&mdash;newspaper publisher Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) and his wife art gallery owner Christina Drayton (Katharine Hepburn)&mdash;are purported liberals who have instilled in her the idea of racial equality.
But although they try to hide it, Joanna's parents and in particular her father are initially upset that she is planning to marry a black man.
The Draytons' black maid, Tillie (Isabel Sanford), is even more horrified, suspecting that John is trying to "get above himself" by marrying a white woman.
Joanna is oblivious to the reactions of her parents.
They are unsettled by her engagement with John since they never thought that her choice would be a black man, and further unsettled by John's decision that if Joanna's parents do not accept the engagement that day, that he will end it.
Adding to the situation is that Joanna, at first intending to join John in a few weeks in Geneva for their planned marriage ceremony, has changed her mind to leave after dinner on his flight to New York City and then onward to Europe.
She has also invited John's parents (Roy Glenn and Beah Richards) to dinner so that they can all become acquainted.
Due to this invitation, what was intended to be a sit-down steak dinner for two turns into a meet-the-in-laws dinner party.
Furthermore, John is forced to reveal that he had not yet told his parents of his intention to marry a white girl.
Matt's golf buddy Monsignor Mike Ryan (Cecil Kellaway), a Catholic priest, stops by after Matt earlier cancelled on playing golf.
After learning of John, he shares Joanna's enthusiasm for the pending nuptials and tells her father as much.
Matt says he cannot give the couple his blessing however; he fears that Joanna will be hurt by the prejudice that she and John will surely encounter.
Meanwhile, one of Christina's employees at her gallery, Hilary (Virginia Christine), who'd briefly met John and Joanna earlier in the day, stops by the Draytons' home to express her disapproval over the relationship and, though Christina herself is still unsure of her own feelings about the matter, she is so offended at Hilary's racism that she fires her on the spot.
Later, when dressing for dinner, Christina shares with Matt her support for Joanna, even if it should mean having to fight her husband.
Cocktails at the Drayton home is musical chairs of different sets of parental characters who share their views about the situation; it shows that the mothers have more faith in their children than the fathers.
Universally, it had been expressed by the parents that more than a few hours are necessary for a proper decision, but John's mother brings up her idea of what the men are missing about the situation: passion.
When the elder Prentice tells John that he is making a huge mistake, John says that his father thinks of himself as a black man, whereas John thinks of himself as a man.
mrs Prentice tells Matt that he and her husband, in growing old, have forgotten what it's like to feel romantic passion.
If they remembered, they would see that in their children as being more important than any racial problem.
After thinking about the situation, and his conversation with mrs Prentice in particular, Matt calls everyone together to make an announcement.
He says that it does not matter what everyone else may think about John and Joanna getting married: all that matters is that they love each other.
The film ends with the two families and Monsignor Ryan finally sitting down to dinner.

Bringing Up Baby

David Huxley (Cary Grant) is a mild-mannered paleontologist.
For the past four years, he has been trying to assemble the skeleton of a Brontosaurus but is missing one bone: the "intercostal clavicle".
Adding to his stress is his impending marriage to the dour Alice Swallow (Virginia Walker) and the need to impress Elizabeth Random (May Robson), who is considering a million-dollar donation to his museum.
The day before his wedding, David meets Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) by chance on a golf course.
She is a free-spirited young lady, and (unknown to him at first) mrs Random's niece.
Susan's brother, Mark, has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby (Nissa) to give to their aunt.
(The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America) Susan thinks David is a zoologist (rather than a paleontologist), and persuades David to go to her country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby (which includes singing "I Can't Give You Anything But Love" to soothe the leopard).
Complications arise since Susan has fallen in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage.
David finally receives the intercostal clavicle, but Susan's dog George (Asta) takes it out of its box and buries it.
Susan's aunt, Elizabeth Random, arrives.
The dowager is unaware of David's identity, since Susan has introduced him as "Mr.
Bone".
Baby and George run off, and Susan and David mistake a dangerous leopard who was being driven to be euthanized from a nearby circus (also portrayed by Nissa) for Baby, and let it out of the cage.
After considerable running around, David and Susan are jailed by a befuddled town policeman, Constable Slocum (Walter Catlett), for breaking into the house of dr Fritz Lehman (Fritz Feld) (where they had cornered the circus leopard).
When Slocum does not believe their story, Susan tells him they are members of the "Leopard Gang"; she calls herself "Swingin' Door Susie", and David "Jerry the Nipper".
David fails to convince the constable that Susan makes things up "from motion pictures she's seen".
Eventually, Alexander Peabody (George Irving) shows up to verify everyone's identity.
Susan, who during a police interview contrived to sneak out a window, unwittingly drags the irritated circus leopard into the jail.
David saves her, using a chair to shoo the big cat into a cell.
Some time later Susan finds David, who has just been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high platform at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum.
After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur to be closer to him.
She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life.
Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder is on the verge of falling over.
Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform.
Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.

Sullivan's Travels

John Sullivan (Joel McCrea) is a popular young Hollywood director of profitable but shallow comedies (eg.
Ants in Your Plants).
Sullivan is dissatisfied despite his success and tells his studio boss, mr Lebrand (Robert Warwick) that he wants his next project to be a serious exploration of the plight of the downtrodden.
He asks to make his next film an adaptation of O Brother, Where Art Thou.
, a socially-conscious novel.
Lebrand wants him to direct another lucrative comedy instead, but the idealistic Sullivan refuses to give in.
He wants to "know trouble" first-hand, and plans to travel as a tramp so he can return and make a film that depicts the sorrows of humanity.
His butler (Robert Greig) and valet (Eric Blore) openly question the wisdom of his plan.
Sullivan dresses as a penniless hobo and takes to the road, followed by a fully staffed double-decker coach at Lebrand's request.
Neither party is happy with the arrangement; and Sullivan eventually persuades his guardians to leave him alone and arranges to rendezvous with them in Las Vegas later.
However, when he hitchhikes alone, he finds himself back in Los Angeles where he started.
There he meets a young failed actress (Veronica Lake, credited only as "The Girl") who is just about to quit the business and go home.
She believes he is truly a tramp, and buys him a breakfast of eggs and ham.
In return for her kindness, Sullivan retrieves his car from his estate and gives her a lift.
He neglects to tell his servants that he has returned; so they report the "theft" of the car and Sullivan and the Girl are apprehended by the police.
Upon their release, the Girl pushes him into his enormous swimming pool for deceiving her about his true identity.
However, after considering her options, she becomes his traveling companion.
This time Sullivan succeeds in living like a hobo.
After eating in soup kitchens and sleeping in homeless shelters with the Girl, Sullivan finally decides he has had enough.
His experiment is publicized by the studio as a huge success.
The Girl wants to stay with him, but is stymied by his complicated living situation.
On the advice of his business manager, Sullivan had gotten married to reduce his income tax.
Ironically, he discovers that his wife cost him double what he saved in taxes.
Sullivan decides to thank the homeless by handing out $5 bills, but one man, who had previously stolen his shoes, ambushes Sullivan and steals the money.
Sullivan is knocked unconscious and thrown onto a train boxcar leaving the city.
The thief drops the loose cash on the rails, getting run over and killed by another train while picking it up.
When the thief's body is found, they discover a special identification card in his shoes identifying him as Sullivan.
The mangled body is assumed to be Sullivan's, and his staff and the Girl are informed of his death.
Meanwhile, Sullivan wakes up in the rail yard of another city, with no memory of who he is or how he got there.
In his confused state, he assaults the railroad worker who finds him, for which he is sentenced to six years in a labor camp.
Sullivan slowly regains his memory.
While in the labor camp, Sullivan attends a showing of Walt Disney's Playful Pluto cartoon.
Looking at the pure joy in the audience's faces, Sullivan realizes that comedy can do more good for the poor than his proposed social drama, O Brother, Where Art Thou.
But Sullivan still has a problem – he cannot convince anybody that he is Sullivan.
Finally, he comes up with a solution: he confesses to being his own killer.
When his picture makes the front page of the newspapers, the Girl recognizes him and gets him released.
His "widow" had already taken up with his crooked business manager, so he can now divorce her and be reunited with the Girl.
A montage of happily laughing faces ends the film.

Cinderella

Giambattista Basile, an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled Lo cunto de li cunti (The Story of Stories), or Pentamerone.
It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper.
It was published posthumously in 1634.
Plot: One of the most popular versions of Cinderella was written in French by Charles Perrault in 1697, under the name Cendrillon.
The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the pumpkin, the fairy-godmother and the introduction of "glass" slippers.
Plot:  The first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.
Without it, nothing is possible; with it, one can do anything.
However, the second moral of the story mitigates the first one and reveals the criticism that Perrault is aiming at: That "without doubt it is a great advantage to have intelligence, courage, good breeding, and common sense.
These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them.
However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother".
Another well-known version was recorded by the German brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the 19th century.
The tale is called "Aschenputtel" ("Cinderella" in English translations).
This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the step sisters cut off their own toes to fit in the golden slipper.
In addition, there is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that she planted on her mother's grave.
Plot:  Aschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; Perrault's version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter.
However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child.
He also describes Aschenputtel as his "first wife's child" and not his own.
Villains: In some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular Disney film, Cinderella's father has died and Cinderella's mother has died also.
Although many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type 510A is a female persecutor: in Fair, Brown and Trembling and Finette Cendron, the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen.
In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her.
Of this type (510B) are Cap O' Rushes, Catskin, All-Kinds-of-Fur, and Allerleirauh, and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.
In Katie Woodencloak, the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.
In La Cenerentola, Gioachino Rossini inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her stepfather.
(This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' dowries larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry.
Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.
Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew: The number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three.
The fairy godmother is Perrault's own addition to the tale.
The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the Grimms's version is her dead mother.
Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing.
Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball.
This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as The Cinder Maid, collected by Joseph Jacobs, and the Finnish The Wonderful Birch.
Playwright James Lapine incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical Into the Woods.
Giambattista Basile's Cenerentola combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing.
Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in Katie Woodencloak, Rushen Coatie, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah, The Story of Tam and Cam, or The Sharp Grey Sheep—these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in The Golden Slipper, a fish aids her after she puts it in water.
In "The Anklet", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball.
Gioachino Rossini, having agreed to do an opera based on Cinderella if he could omit all magical elements, wrote La Cenerentola, in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.
The midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired.
In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.
Furthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as Katie Woodencloak and The Golden Slipper have her attend church.
In the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty.
However, on the third (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes.
In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds—or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.
The identifying item: The glass slipper is unique to Charles Perrault's version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the Brothers Grimm, German: Aschenbroedel and Aschenputtel, for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity.
In Rossini's opera "La Cenerentola" ("Cinderella"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity.
In the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers.
Interpreters unaware of the value attached to glass in 17th century France and perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's "glass slipper" (pantoufle de verre) had been a "squirrel fur slipper" (pantoufle de vair) in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.
The 1950 Disney adaptation takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.
Another interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element—the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a 'Droit du seigneur' right of sexual possession of his subjects.
The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).
The translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason.
Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone.
In Terry Pratchett's Witches Abroad, the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her.
In "When the Clock Strikes" (from Red As Blood), Tanith Lee had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.
The Revelation: Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.
In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother.
The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.
In many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged.
Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters.
In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.
The prince nevertheless insists on her trying.
Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).
The Conclusion: In the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds.
In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.
In The Thousand Nights and A Night, in a tale called "The Anklet", the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night.
In The Wonderful Birch, the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth.
Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.
In an episode of Jim Henson's The Storyteller, writer Anthony Minghella merged the old folk tale Donkeyskin (also written by Perrault) with Cinderella to tell the tale of Sapsorrow, a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.
Many popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other.
Examples are the film Ever After, Cinderella 3 and the Broadway revival.
Ever After (known in promotional material as Ever After: A Cinderella Story) is a 1998 American romantic comedy-drama film inspired by the fairy tale Cinderella, directed by Andy Tennant and starring Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott.
The usual pantomime and comic/supernatural elements are removed and the story is instead treated as historical fiction, set in Renaissance-era France.
It is often seen as a modern, post-feminism interpretation of the Cinderella myth.
There is also Gregory Maguire's novel Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, which gives the classic story from the view of one of the ugly stepsisters.
In this version, the Cinderella character is unusually beautiful, but also a shy enigma.
Her stepsister, though plain, is charming and intelligent.
The novel has themes much more adult than the traditional story.
Likewise there is a Marissa Meyer novel Cinder, which is set in a futuristic Beijing.
The Cinderella character, named Cinder, is a cyborg mechanic, who meets Prince Kaito.
Gail Carson Levine wrote Ella Enchanted, a story about how "Ella" is under a fairy curse of obedience (she does whatever someone tells her to).
A movie also has been made based on this book.
In 1982, Roald Dahl rewrote the story in a more modern and gruesome way in his book Revolting Rhymes.
In his book dr Gardner's Fairy Tales for Today's Children, dr Richard Gardener's story "Cinderelma" has the heroine Cinderelma and the prince re-unite, then mutually decide to separate.
Cinderelma then gets a job as a seamstress, later opens her own dress shop, and marries a young printer who owns the shop next door to hers.
In 1995, Richard Conlon's play Anastasia and Drizella was produced at Chicago's Temporary Theatre.
In it, Cinderella's step sister Anastasia gets a master's degree in finance, and her step sister Drizella gets a master's degree in chemical engineering.
When the prince tries to have Cinderella's step family beheaded, Anastasia buys the kingdom.
The prince and Cinderella get married, and spend the rest of their lives working as servants for Cinderella's step family, while the step sisters live happily ever after.
In the 2005 picture book Ella's Big Chance by Shirley Hughes, Ella is a dressmaker in her father's shop, and when the stepsisters arrive they appoint themselves as models.
Ella eventually chooses to marry Buttons, an employee in the shop, instead of the prince.
In Emily Short's 2006 interactive fiction short story Glass, it is Cinderella herself who has magical powers, and neither her stepmother nor her stepsisters are malicious.
The royal ambitions of the stepmother plays a small part in their attempt to deceive the prince, but more importantly they are trying to protect Cinderella from the law of the land, under which practicing magic is punishable by death.
In 2014, Bad Wolf Press published a musical version called Cinderella: A Modern Makeover, a fractured interpretation of the story featuring a more positive "blended family" home life as well as a heroine trying to get her dream job at the palace instead of a marriage proposal.
Also in 2014, Rae Magdon published an unusual retelling of the story in a novel titled The Second Sister, in which the protagonist, Ellie, is somewhat forced into stopping one of her step-sisters from enchanting the Prince and take over the entire Kingdom.
In order to do this, she receives the help of a shy maid, a friendly cook, a talking cat, and her mysterious second sister.
Anne Sexton wrote an adaptation as a poem called "Cinderella" in her collection Transformations (1971), a book in which she re-envisions sixteen of the Grimm's Fairy tales.
The Throne of Glass series, written by Sarah Maas, is inspired by the story of Cinderella.
Bridget Hodder has written The Rat Prince, a middle grade novel telling the Cinderella story from the point of view of one of Cinderella's rodent friends.
FSG/MacMillan is publishing the book August 23, 2016.

The Gold Rush

The following is the plot of the 1942 re-release:  Big Jim, a gold prospector during the Klondike Gold Rush, has just found an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a blizzard strikes.
The Lone Prospector gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold.
He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal.
Larsen tries to throw him out when Jim also stumbles inside.
Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim, and the three agree to an uneasy truce where they all can stay in the cabin.
When the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain some more.
Larsen loses and leaves the cabin.
While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns.
Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes.
Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him.
At that moment, a bear enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food.
After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit.
There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel.
While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen is swept to his death in an avalanche.
Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, but he has lost his memory from the blow.
When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he had found a large gold deposit, that the deposit was close to a certain cabin and that he had stayed in the cabin with the Prospector.
But he knows neither the location of the deposit nor of the cabin.
So, he goes looking for the Prospector, hoping that he still knows the location of the cabin.
The Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl.
To irritate Jack, a ladies' man who is making aggressive advances toward her and pestering her for a dance, she instead decides to dance with "the most deplorable looking tramp in the dance hall", the Prospector, who instantly falls in love with her.
After encountering each other again, she accepts his invitation for a New Year's Eve dinner, but does not take it seriously and soon forgets about it.
While waiting for her to arrive to the dinner, the Prospector imagines entertaining her with a dance of bread rolls on forks.
When she does not arrive until midnight, he walks alone through the streets, desperate.
At that moment, she remembers his invitation and decides to visit him.
Finding his home empty but seeing the meticulously prepared dinner and a present for her, she has a change of heart and prepares a note for him in which she asks to talk to him.
When the Prospector is handed the note, he goes searching for Georgia.
But at the same moment, Jim finds him and drags him away to go search for the cabin, giving the Prospector only enough time to shout to Georgia that he soon will return to her as a millionaire.
Jim and the Prospector find the cabin and stay for the night.
Overnight, another blizzard blows the cabin half over a cliff right next to Jim's gold deposit.
The next morning the cabin rocks dangerously over the cliff edge while the two try to escape.
At last Jim manages to get out and pull the Prospector to safety right when the cabin falls down the chasm.
One year later both have become wealthy.
But the Prospector was not able to find Georgia.
They return to the contiguous United States on a ship on which, unknown to them, Georgia is also travelling.
When the Prospector agrees to don his old clothes for a photograph, he falls down the stairs, encountering Georgia once more.
After she mistakes him for a stowaway and tries to save him from the ship's crew, the misunderstanding is cleared up and both are happily reunited.

His Girl Friday

Walter determines to sabotage these plans, enticing the reluctant Hildy to cover one last story, the upcoming execution of convicted murderer Earl Williams (John Qualen).

The Mexican

The story follows Jerry Welbach as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States.
Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese, who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk.
In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman.
Retrieving the gun will be his final errand.
Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha, with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship.
Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck, the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun.
There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire.
Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival.
Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside.
Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck.
Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy, who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead.
It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha.
They pick up a postal worker named Frank, who then has a relationship with Leroy.
Another hitman follows them to Las Vegas and kills Frank to make it look like a suicide.
Leroy kills him in an act of vengeance, and flees with Samantha.
Jerry finds out that Ted, his friend and colleague, wanted to kill him and take the pistol to Margolese, but hesitated and ends up getting handcuffed to a pawnshop owner, after he received the gun from a policeman when Jerry was being interrogated for the bloodstain on the front passenger seat of his car.
Jerry then finds out he accidentally grabbed Ted's Passport and tries to retrieve his own, but Ted has already fled.
Jerry decides to pick up Samantha and Leroy at the airport, where Leroy recognizes him, but Jerry doesn't recognize Leroy.
Without a passport, Jerry is stuck in Mexico until further notice by the American Consulate.
After their car has a blowout, Jerry kills Leroy and finds out that he is one of Nayman's men named Winston Baldry, and that the real Leroy was the man Winston killed.
Samantha begins to realize that Leroy was not who he appeared to be when they first met.
Jerry realizes that Nayman's plan was to make it look like Jerry double crossed Margolese.
Shocked by this, Samantha decides to go home, but also decides to stay with Jerry to see the situation to the end.
Jerry gets assaulted and taken to Margolese who was released from prison a few days earlier.
He tells Jerry that he didn't double cross him as it was Bernie who wanted to sell the pistol to the highest bidder.
A gunsmith, who is the great-grandson of the gunsmith from the story, wanted to bring the pistol back to where it belongs.
He thanks Jerry for risking his life for the pistol he was going to give to his greedy boss.
Samantha gets kidnapped by Bernie in order to get the pistol from Margolese.
After opening the trunk to his car, she pulls the gun on Bernie, blaming him for ruining her life, where it ends in a Mexican standoff.
Samantha gets the upper hand and kills Bernie with the pistol he desperately needed.
Jerry and Samantha rekindle their romance and get married in Mexico, while Margolese finally gets his prize, as well as the gunsmith.

Pike is a woman-shy snake expert Ophidiologist, just returning from a year-long expedition up the Amazon.
Though surrounded by ladies desperate for his attention, Charles is putty in Jean's hands.
But even the best laid plans can go astray.
First, Jean falls hard for Pike and shields him from her card sharp father.
Then, when Pike's suspicious minder/valet Muggsy (William Demarest) discovers the truth about her and her father, Pike dumps her.
Furious at being scorned, she re-enters his life masquerading as the posh "Lady Eve Sidwich", niece of Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith (Eric Blore), another con man who's been swindling the rich folk of Connecticut.
Jean is determined to torment Pike mercilessly, as she explains, "I've got some unfinished business with him—I need him like the axe needs the turkey".
When Pike meets "Eve", he is so bewildered he constantly trips and falls over himself.
Although Muggsy tries to convince him "she's the same dame", Pike reasons that Jean would never come close to his home without at least disguising herself, so he concludes the resemblance is only a coincidence.
After a brief courtship, they marry, and on the train to their honeymoon, "Eve" begins to confess her past, dropping name after name after name of old boyfriends and lovers.
Pike finally gets fed up and jumps off the train.
Now separated, Jean's con team urges her to close the deal, saying she's got him over a barrel and can make a killing in a settlement.
While Charles' father and lawyers are on the phone with her pleading to settle quickly, Jean says she doesn't want any money at all, just for Pike to tell her it's over to her face.
Pike refuses, and through his father Jean learns that he's departing on another ocean voyage.
She arranges her own passage, and "bumps into" Pike, just as they met before.
"Hopsie" is overjoyed to see Jean again, and they instantly dash to her cabin where they mutually affirm their love for each other.
Charles confesses that he is married, and Jean replies tenderly, "So am I, darling".

My Man Godfrey

During the Great Depression, Godfrey "Smith" Parke (William Powell) is living alongside other men down on their luck at a New York City dump on the East River near the 59th Street Bridge.
One night, spoiled socialite Cornelia Bullock (Gail Patrick) offers him five dollars to be her "forgotten man" for a scavenger hunt.
Annoyed, he advances on her, causing her to retreat and fall on a pile of ashes.
She leaves in a fury, much to the glee of her younger sister, Irene (Carole Lombard).
After talking with her, Godfrey finds her to be kind, if a bit scatter-brained.
He offers to go with Irene to help her beat Cornelia.
In the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene's long-suffering businessman father, Alexander Bullock (Eugene Pallette), waits resignedly as his ditsy wife, Angelica (Alice Brady), and her mooching "protégé" Carlo (Mischa Auer) play the game.
Godfrey arrives and is authenticated as a "forgotten man".
He then addresses the crowd, expressing his contempt for their antics.
Irene is apologetic and offers him a job as the family butler, which he gratefully accepts.
The next morning, Godfrey is shown what to do by the Bullocks' sardonic, wise-cracking maid, Molly (Jean Dixon), the only servant who has been able to put up with the antics of the family.
She warns him that he is merely the latest in a long line of butlers.
Only slightly daunted, he proves to be surprisingly competent, although Cornelia holds a grudge against him.
On the other hand, Irene considers Godfrey to be her protégé.
A complication arises when Tommy Gray (Alan Mowbray), a lifelong friend of Godfrey's, recognizes him at a tea party thrown by Irene.
Godfrey quickly ad-libs that he was Tommy's valet at Harvard.
Tommy plays along, embellishing Godfrey's story with a nonexistent wife and five children.
Dismayed, Irene impulsively announces her engagement to the surprised Charlie Van Rumple (Grady Sutton), but she soon breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey.
Over lunch the next day, Tommy is curious to know what one of the elite "Parkes of Boston" is doing as a servant.
Godfrey explains that a broken love affair had left him considering suicide, but the undaunted attitude of the men living at the dump rekindled his spirits.
During lunch, Cornelia has her longstanding boyfriend "Faithful George" (Robert Light) call Tommy away to the telephone.
She takes a seat at Godfrey's table and attempts to negotiate a peace with him — but only on her terms.
Godfrey declines and Cornelia leaves in a huff.
When everything she does to make Godfrey's life miserable fails, Cornelia plants her pearl necklace under his mattress.
She then calls the police to report her missing jewelry.
To Cornelia's surprise, the pearls do not turn up when Godfrey's suite is searched.
mr Bullock realizes his daughter has orchestrated the whole thing and sees the policemen out.
After they have gone, he informs Cornelia she had better find her pearls herself, as they are not insured.
The Bullocks then send their daughters off to Europe to get Irene away from her now-broken engagement.
When they return, Cornelia implies that she intends to seduce Godfrey.
Worried, Irene stages a fainting spell and falls into Godfrey's arms.
He carries her to her bed, but while searching for smelling salts, he realizes she is faking when he sees her (in a mirror) sit up briefly.
In revenge, he puts her in the shower and turns on the cold water full blast.
Far from quenching her attraction, this merely confirms her hopes: "Oh Godfrey, now I know you love me.
You do or you wouldn't have lost your temper".
Godfrey resigns as the Bullocks' butler.
However, mr Bullock has more pressing concerns.
He first throws Carlo out, then announces to his family and Godfrey that his business is in dire straits and that he might even face criminal charges.
Godfrey interrupts with good news: he had sold short, using money raised by pawning Cornelia's necklace, and bought the stock that Bullock had sold.
He gives the endorsed stock certificates to the stunned mr Bullock, saving the family.
He also returns the necklace to a humbled Cornelia, who apologizes.
Godfrey then leaves.
With his stock profits and reluctant business partner Tommy Gray's backing, Godfrey has built a fashionable nightclub at the now-closed East River dump called "The Dump", ".
giving food and shelter to fifty people in the winter, and giving them employment in the summer".
Godfrey tells Tommy he quit the Bullocks because "he felt that foolish feeling coming along again".
However, a determined Irene tracks him down in his manager's apartment at The Dump and bulldozes him into marriage, saying, "Stand still, Godfrey, it'll all be over in a minute".

Road to Morocco

The film opens with a freighter at sea exploding and news announcements.
The cause of the explosion is a mystery, with all crew accounted for with the exception of two unidentified stowaways.
Jeff Peters (Bing Crosby) and Orville 'Turkey' Jackson (Bob Hope) are seen floating at sea aboard a pile of wreckage.
It was Jeff's idea to stow away, but it was Orville 'smoking in the powder room' that caused the explosion.
As the two joke about eating one another to survive, they spot land in the distance.
As they sit on the beach, Orville reminds Jeff of his promise to Aunt Lucy, to take care of him.
Jeff reminds him that Aunt Lucy died before he could agree.
They are interrupted by a convenient camel, and they hitch a ride.
Once in the city, they are nearly run over by Arabs shooting guns, led by the sheik Mullay Kasim (Anthony Quinn).
Jeff and Orville learn the sheik is pursuing a princess for marriage.
Orville is approached by a group of bearers carrying someone in a veiled box.
A beautiful hand takes his and then leaves, with Orville in pure bliss.
In a restaurant, Jeff and Orville eat heartily, while trying to figure out how to get past the knife-wielding owner without paying.
A man (Dan Seymour) takes Jeff aside and hands over a great deal of money.
Orville is happy to be able to pay for the meal, until he learns that Jeff 'sold' him.
Orville is furious, especially since neither of them know why the man bought him.
Jeff calms him down and tells Orville he'll buy him back, eventually; and two men throw a hood over Orville and carry him off.
A week later, Jeff is woken by a vision of Aunt Lucy (played by a harp-wielding Bob Hope) who shames him for his act.
Jeff says he tried to buy Orville back, but learned he was re-sold to someone else.
Aunt Lucy tells him he has to find Orville, and recommends singing Orville's favorite song.
Jeff walks through the street singing, (accompanied by Aunt Lucy's ghost) until a note, with Orville's locket is tossed at him from the palace window.
The note, written by Orville, says he's being tortured and warns Jeff of danger.
Jeff, thinking Orville is in trouble, scales the palace wall.
Hearing a woman singing, Jeff sneaks into the palace and see a lot of beautiful girls dancing for the beautiful Princess Shalmar (Dorothy Lamour) and singing to a very relaxed Orville.
Jeff storms in and is grabbed by guards.
Orville feigns ignorance and tries to send him away.
The princess dismisses everyone, except for Jeff.
Orville admits the truth, but it's clear he's still mad at Jeff.
He says he and the princess are to be married.
Jeff is surprised, but the princess says her wise man read the stars and told her to marry Orville.
She was the one that passed Orville in the veiled box, and also the one that purchased him.
As she plants a passionate kiss on Orville, Jeff decides to stick around; a decision that almost brings him and Orville to blows, but the princess invites Jeff to stay.
As Orville is waited on by beautiful girls, he learns from one of them, Mihirmah, the princess was supposed to marry Kasim, but also tells Orville she loves him too.
Jeff breaks up the party and confronts Orville, who has Jeff thrown out.
Jeff wanders the palace singing, an act that attracts the princess and they go on a moonlit walk.
Mihirmah tries to get Orville to run away with her.
Jeff tries to tell the princess that HE was the one sold and should be marrying her, but he is interrupted by a sword-wielding Orville.
The next morning an angry Kasim confronts Princess Shalmar for marrying someone else.
He is prepared to kill Orville but the princess takes him to the wise man Hyder Kahn.
Hyder Khan said he had read the stars and found that Princess Shalmar's first husband is destined to die a violent death within a week of the marriage, and the second husband would be blessed with long life and happiness.
The princess tells Kasim that Orville is the first husband, and when he dies, she'll happily marry Kasim and they will live in happiness.
Kasim finally understands and embraces the princess.
Orville finds out about the prophecy and runs to Jeff and convinces him that the princess actually loves him and he's going to run off with Mihirmah.
Later that night, Orville is visited and shamed by Aunt Lucy's spirit, but Orville refuses to tell Jeff the truth.
Meanwhile, the wise man realizes that he had been misreading the stars due to fireflies in his telescope; his prophecies are incorrect.
Princess Shalmar refuses to marry Jeff, even though Orville is eager to get out of the marriage.
The princess sends Orville away to get ready for the wedding.
The wise man runs in and tells the princess and Jeff of the incorrect prophecy.
The princess is happy and tells Jeff now she can marry him and not Kasim.
Jeff realizes why Orville was so eager to get out of the marriage, but decides not to tell him.
Instead he says the princess changed her mind, and Orville is only too eager to accept.
Meanwhile, the wise man's assistant tells Kasim, who rallies his men.
The Princess and Jeff decide to get married in the, accompanied by Orville and Mihirmah but they are confronted by Kasim, who takes the princess and gives Mihirmah to one of his men.
Jeff and Orville try to use their 'patty-cake' routine on Kasim, but it backfires.
They escape into the palace with the girls but are found and captured.
Kasim takes the women and strands Jeff and Orville in the desert.
They wander aimlessly, seeing a drive-in restaurant, but it's a mirage.
They see a vision of a singing Princess Shalmar, which spurs them onward.
They find an oasis which is near Kasim's camp.
They try to sneak in, but are captured.
They see another set of horsemen and learn it is an enemy sheik who was invited as a token of peace.
They manage to escape and set the two sheiks against each other.
In the chaos Jeff and Orville grab the girls and escape.
Later, on a boat home, Orville sneaks into the powder room for a cigarette.
There is an explosion and then we see all four afloat a pile of wreckage.
Fortunately, they are near New York harbor.

Not recognizing her, he offers her money so she can take a taxi home, but a woozy "Anya Smith" (as she later calls herself) refuses to cooperate.
Joe finally decides, for safety's sake, to let her spend the night in his apartment.
He is amused by her regal manner, but less so when she appropriates his bed.
He transfers her to a couch.
The next morning, Joe, having already slept through the interview Princess Ann was scheduled to give, hurries off to work, leaving her still asleep.
When his editor, mr Hennessy (Hartley Power), asks why Joe is late, Joe lies, claiming to have attended the princess' press conference.
Joe makes up details of the alleged interview until Hennessy informs him that the event had been canceled because the princess had suddenly "fallen ill".
Joe sees a newspaper picture of her and realizes who is in his apartment.
Immediately seeing an opportunity, Joe proposes getting an exclusive interview.
Hennessy, not knowing the circumstances, agrees to the deal and offers $5,000 if the interview is all Joe claims it will be, but bets Joe $500 that he will not succeed.
Joe hurries home and, hiding the fact that he is a reporter, offers to show "Anya" around Rome.
He also surreptitiously calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), to tag along to secretly take pictures.
However, Ann declines Joe's offer and leaves.
Ann, enjoying her freedom, explores an outdoor market, buys a pair of shoes, and, on a whim, gets her long hair cut short.
Joe follows and "accidentally" meets her on the Spanish Steps.
This time he convinces her to spend the day with him.
They see the sights, including the "Mouth of Truth", a face carved in marble which is said to bite off the hands of liars.
When Joe shouts in mock pain and pulls his hand out of the mouth, it appears to be missing, causing Ann to scream.
He then pops his hand out of his sleeve and laughs.
(Allegedly, Hepburn's shriek was not acting&mdash;Peck decided to pull a gag he had once seen Red Skelton do, and did not tell his co-star beforehand)  Later, Ann shares with Joe her dream of living a normal life without her crushing responsibilities.
That night, at a dance on a boat, government agents finally track her down and try to escort her away, but a wild melee breaks out and Joe and Ann escape.
While trying to rescue her from plainclothes government agents, Joe is ambushed and falls into a river after being struck.
Ann dives in to save him, and they swim away together away from the agents, finally sharing a kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank.
Later, knowing her royal responsibilities must resume, the princess bids a tearful farewell to Joe and returns to the embassy.
When she arrives at the embassy she is lectured upon the sense of duty she must display, but (visibly pained) retorts that without such a sense, she would never have returned.
During the course of the day, Hennessy learns that the princess is missing, not ill as claimed.
He suspects that Joe knows where she is and tries to get him to admit it, but Joe claims to know nothing about it.
Joe decides not to write the story, despite the considerable amount of money riding on it.
Irving first plans to sell his photographs independent of the story, but eventually decides against it.
The next day, Princess Ann appears to answer questions from the press, and is surprised to see Joe and Irving there.
Irving takes her picture with the same miniature cigarette-lighter/camera he had used the previous day.
When asked by a reporter which city of her European tour was her favorite, Ann first makes a diplomatic "all were equally good" answer, but interrupts it with an impulsive "Rome.
By all means, Rome".
At the end of the interview, the Princess requests to "meet" the journalists, shaking hands and making brief formal conversation.
As she reaches Joe and Irving, the latter presents her with an envelope with the photographs he had taken, under the pretext of a generic memento of Rome.
The three make several statements that hint at the truth and their dispositions, while feigning formality and the distance expected between the princess and two strange journalists.
As the interview with the princess comes to an end and she reluctantly leaves, the crowd of journalists and reporters eventually disperses, and Joe walks away alone.

Safety Last!

The film opens in 1922 with Harold Lloyd (the character has the same name as the actor) behind bars.
His mother and his girlfriend, Mildred, are consoling him as a somber official and priest show up.
The three of them walk toward what looks like a noose.
It then becomes obvious they are at a train station and the "noose" is actually a trackside pickup hoop used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the ticket barrier.
He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has "made good" in the big city.
Then he is off.
He gets a job as a salesclerk at the De Vore Department Store, where he has to pull various stunts to get out of trouble with the picky and arrogantly self-important head floorwalker, mr Stubbs.
He shares a rented room with his pal "Limpy" Bill, a construction worker.
When Harold finishes his shift, he sees an old friend from his hometown who is now a policeman walking the beat.
After he leaves, Bill shows up.
Bragging to Bill about his supposed influence with the police department, he persuades Bill to knock the policeman backwards over him while the man is using a callbox.
When Bill does so, he knocks over the wrong policeman.
To escape, he climbs up the façade of a building.
The policeman tries to follow, but cannot get past the first floor; in frustration, he shouts at Bill, "You'll do time for this.
The first time I lay eyes on you again, I'll pinch you.
"  Meanwhile, Harold has been hiding his lack of success by sending his girlfriend expensive presents he cannot really afford.
She mistakenly thinks he is successful enough to support a family and, with his mother's encouragement, takes a train to join him.
In his embarrassment, he has to pretend to be the general manager, even succeeding in impersonating him to get back at Stubbs.
While going to retrieve her purse (which Mildred left in the manager's office), he overhears the real general manager say he would give $1,000 to anyone who could attract people to the store.
He remembers Bill's talent and pitches the idea of having a man climb the "12-story Bolton building", which De Vore's occupies.
He gets Bill to agree to do it by offering him $500.
The stunt is highly publicized and a large crowd gathers the next day.
When a drunkard shows "The Law" (the policeman who was pushed over) a newspaper story about the event, the lawman suspects Bill is going to be the climber.
He waits at the starting point despite Harold's frantic efforts to get him to leave.
Finally, unable to wait any longer, Bill suggests Harold climb the first story himself and then switch his hat and coat with Bill, who will continue on from there.
After Harold starts up, the policeman spots Bill and chases him into the building.
Every time Harold tries to switch places with Bill, the policeman appears and chases Bill away.
Each time, Bill tells his friend he will meet him on the next floor up.
Eventually, Harold reaches the top, despite his troubles with a clock and some hungry pigeons, and kisses his girl.

The Shop Around the Corner

Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) is the top salesman at a leathergoods shop in Budapest owned by the high-strung mr Hugo Matuschek (Frank Morgan).
Kralik's coworkers at Matuschek and Company include his friend, Pirovitch (Felix Bressart), a kindly family man; Ferencz Vadas (Joseph Schildkraut), a two-faced womanizer; and Pepi Katona (William Tracy), an ambitious, precocious delivery boy.
One morning, Kralik reveals to Pirovitch that he's been corresponding anonymously with an intelligent and cultured woman whose ad he came across in the newspaper.
Kralik is mr Matuschek's oldest and most trusted employee—just invited to a dinner party at Matuschek's home—but lately there has been tension between the two.
They get into an argument over mr Matuschek's idea to sell a cigarette box that plays "Ochi Chërnye" when opened.
Kralik thinks it's a bad idea.
Although annoyed with Kralik's stubbornness, Matuschek is reluctant to ignore his judgment.
After their exchange, Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) enters the gift shop looking for a job.
Kralik tells her there are no openings, but when she is able to sell one of the cigarette boxes (as a candy box), mr Matuschek hires her.
As Christmas approaches, Kralik is preparing to finally meet his mystery correspondent for a dinner date.
Planning to propose if the date works out, Kralik requests a raise from mr Matuschek, who has not been in a good mood for months.
Forced to put up with the pesky Miss Novak—the two simply cannot get along—Kralik is grateful that his anonymous correspondent is nothing like her.
He admits to Pirovitch that he is nervous about meeting this "most wonderful girl in the world" for the first time.
Kralik's planned meeting is interrupted when mr Matuschek demands that everyone stay after work.
He and Kralik argue when Kralik mentions his previous engagement.
Later Kralik is called into mr Matuschek's office—and is fired.
No one in the shop understands mr Matuschek's actions; they do not know that mr Matuschek suspects Kralik of having an affair with his wife.
Later, mr Matuschek meets with a private investigator who informs him that his suspicions were correct, that his wife is having an affair with one of his employees—Ferencz Vadas.
Pepi returns to the shop just in time to prevent the distraught mr Matuschek from committing suicide.
Meanwhile, Kralik arrives at the Cafe Nizza, where he discovers that his mystery woman, with the red carnation as planned, is in fact Klara Novak.
Despite his disappointment, Kralik goes in and talks with her, pretending he is there to meet Pirovitch.
In his mind, Kralik tries to reconcile the cultured woman of his letters with his annoying coworker—secretly hoping that things might work out with her.
But concerned that Kralik's presence will spoil her first meeting with her "far superior" mystery correspondent, she calls Kralik a "little insignificant clerk" and asks him to leave, and he does.
Later that night, Kralik goes to the hospital to visit mr Matuschek.
After apologizing for his behavior, mr Matuschek offers him a job as manager of Matuschek and Company, gives him the keys to the shop, and asks him to dismiss Vadas quietly.
Kralik dismisses Vadas, loudly and publicly, pushing Vadas across the shop floor into a pile of cigarette boxes.
Grateful to Pepi for saving his life, mr Matuschek promotes the errand boy to clerk.
The next day, Miss Novak calls in sick after her mystery man failed to show.
That night, Kralik visits her at her apartment, where she reveals her problem to be "psychological".
During his visit, she receives a letter from her correspondent and reads it in front of Kralik (who wrote the letter).
Two weeks later, on Christmas Eve, Matuschek and Company achieves record sales.
A grateful mr Matuschek gives everyone their bonuses and sends them home early.
Then, feeling lonely, he tries to get someone to have dinner with him, but all the employees have other plans.
Finally, Rudy, the new errand boy who lives alone in the city, agrees.
Kralik and Miss Novak, now alone in the shop, talk about their planned dates for the evening and Miss Novak reveals that she had a crush on Kralik when they first met, back when she was "foolish and naive".
After pretending to have met Miss Novak's mystery man—whom he claims is overweight, balding, and unemployed—Kralik puts a blue carnation in his lapel and finally reveals to Miss Novak that he is in fact her mystery correspondent—her "dear friend"—and they kiss.

Some Like It Hot

It is February 1929 in the city of Chicago, during the era of prohibition.
Joe (Tony Curtis) is an irresponsible jazz saxophone player, gambler and ladies' man; his friend Jerry (Jack Lemmon) is a sensible jazz double-bass player; both are working in a speakeasy (disguised as a funeral home) owned by mob gangster "Spats" Colombo (George Raft).
When the joint is raided by the police after being tipped off by informant "Toothpick" Charlie (George Stone), Joe and Jerry flee—only to accidentally witness Spats and his henchmen exacting his revenge on "Toothpick" and his own gang (inspired by the real-life Saint Valentine's Day Massacre).
Penniless and in a mad rush to get out of town, the two musicians take a job with Sweet Sue (Joan Shawlee) and her Society Syncopators, an all-female band headed to Miami.
Disguised as women and renaming themselves Josephine and Daphne, they board a train with the band and their male manager, Bienstock.
Before they board the train, Joe and Jerry notice Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), the band's vocalist and ukulele player.
Joe and Jerry become enamored of Sugar and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises.
Sugar confides that she has sworn off male saxophone players, who have stolen her heart in the past and left her with "the fuzzy end of the lollipop".
She has set her sights on finding a sweet, bespectacled millionaire in Florida.
During the forbidden drinking and partying on the train, Josephine and Daphne become intimate friends with Sugar, and have to struggle to remember that they are supposed to be girls and cannot make a pass at her.
Once in Miami, Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as a millionaire named Junior, the heir to Shell Oil, while feigning disinterest in Sugar.
An actual millionaire, the much-married aging mama's boy Osgood Fielding III, (Joe Brown) tries repeatedly to pick up Daphne, who rebuffs him.
Osgood invites Daphne for a champagne supper on his yacht.
Joe convinces Daphne to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that Junior can take Sugar to Osgood's yacht, passing it off as his.
Once on the yacht, Junior explains to Sugar that, due to psychological trauma, he is impotent and frigid, but that he would marry anyone who could change that.
Sugar tries to arouse some sexual response in Junior, and begins to succeed.
Meanwhile, Daphne and Osgood dance the tango ("La Cumparsita") till dawn.
When Joe and Jerry get back to the hotel, Jerry explains that Osgood has proposed marriage to Daphne and that he, as Daphne, has accepted, anticipating an instant divorce and huge cash settlement when his ruse is revealed.
Joe convinces Jerry that he cannot actually marry Osgood.
The hotel hosts a conference for "Friends of Italian Opera", which is in fact a front for a major meeting of various branches of La Cosa Nostra.
Spats and his gang from Chicago recognize Joe and Jerry as the witnesses to the Valentine's Day murders.
Joe and Jerry, fearing for their lives, realize they must quit the band and leave the hotel.
Joe breaks Sugar's heart by telling her that he, Junior, has to marry a woman of his father's choosing and move to Venezuela.
After several chases, Joe and Jerry witness additional mob killings, this time of Spats and his boys.
Joe, dressed as Josephine, sees Sugar onstage singing that she will never love again.
He kisses her before he leaves, and Sugar realizes that Joe is both Josephine and Junior.
Sugar runs from the stage at the end of her performance and manages to jump into the launch from Osgood's yacht New Caledonia just as it is leaving the dock with Joe, Jerry, and Osgood.
Joe tells Sugar that he is not good enough for her, that she would be getting the "fuzzy end of the lollipop" yet again, but Sugar wants him anyway.
Jerry, for his part, comes up with a list of reasons why he and Osgood cannot get married, ranging from a smoking habit to infertility.
Osgood dismisses them all; he loves Daphne and is determined to go through with the marriage.
Exasperated, Jerry removes his wig and shouts, "I'm a man.
" Osgood simply responds, "Well, nobody's perfect".

Tootsie

Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a respected but perfectionist actor.
Nobody in New York wants to hire him anymore because he is difficult to work with.
According to his long-suffering agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack), Michael's attention to detail and difficult reputation led a commercial he worked on to run significantly over-schedule, because the idea of a tomato sitting down was "illogical" to him.
After many months without a job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime soap opera Southwest General from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester (Teri Garr), who tries out for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly, but doesn't get it.
In desperation, and as a result of his agent telling him that "no one will hire you", he dresses as a woman, auditions as "Dorothy Michaels" and gets the part.
Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play, written by his roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray) and to star Sandy, titled Return to Love Canal.
Michael plays his character as a feisty, feminist administrator, which surprises the other actors and crew who expected Emily to be (as written) another swooning female in the plot.
His character quickly becomes a television sensation.
When Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed (he wanted to try on her clothes in order to get more ideas for Dorothy's outfits), he covers up by professing he wants to have sex with her.
They have sex despite his better judgment about her self-esteem issues.
Michael believes Sandy is too emotionally fragile to handle the truth about him winning the part, especially after noticing her strong resentment of Dorothy.
Their relationship, combined with his deception, complicates his now-busy schedule.
Exacerbating matters further, he is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), a single mother in an unhealthy relationship with the show's amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman).
At a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line that she had previously told Dorothy she would be receptive towards, she throws a drink in his face.
Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie—having just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy's advice—confesses that she has feelings about Dorothy which confuse her, but is not emotionally ready to be in a romantic relationship with a woman.
Meanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn (George Gaynes) and Julie's widowed father Les (Charles Durning).
Les proposes marriage, insisting Michael/Dorothy "think about it" before answering; he leaves immediately and returns home to find co-star John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them.
John apologizes for intruding and leaves.
The tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy's popularity, the show's producers want to extend her contract for another year.
Michael finds a clever way to extricate himself.
When the cast is forced to perform the show live, he improvises a grand speech on camera, pulls off his wig and reveals that he is actually the character's twin brother who took her place to avenge her.
Sandy and Les, who are all watching at home, react with the same level of shock as the cast and crew of the show.
The one exception is Jeff, who was aware of his roommate's "dual role" and remarks, "That is one nutty hospital.
" The revelation allows everybody a more-or-less graceful way out.
Julie, however, is so outraged that she slugs him in the stomach in front of the cast once the cameras have stopped rolling before storming off.
Some weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff's play.
He awkwardly makes peace with Les in a bar, and Les shows tentative support for Michael's attraction to Julie.
Later, Michael waits for Julie outside the studio.
Julie resists talking but finally admits she misses Dorothy.
Michael confesses, "I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man".
At that, she forgives him and they walk off, Julie asking him to lend her a dress.

Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?

In lieu of a theme song and opening of the movie, Tashlin instead laid traditional opening credits over faux television commercials for products that failed to deliver what they promised.
From this comedic segue, the film opens on a writer for television advertising, Rockwell Hunter (Tony Randall), who is low on the ladder at the La Salle agency, the company where he works.
With the agency set to lose its biggest account &ndash; Stay-Put Lipstick &ndash; he hatches an idea to get the perfect model and spokeswoman for Stay-Put's new line of lipstick, the famous actress with the "oh-so-kissable lips", Rita Marlowe (Jayne Mansfield).
For Rita to endorse the lipstick, however, Rock has to pretend to be her boyfriend to make her real boyfriend, Bobo Branigansky (Hargitay), the star of a TV Tarzan show, jealous.
Bobo leaks the news of Rita's new romance to the tabloids and Rock Hunter is suddenly famous as Marlowe's "Lover Doll".
Hunter's boss decides to leverage his employee's newfound fame, but when Hunter also gets Marlowe to agree on a television spectacular sponsored by Stay-Put, Hunter becomes the advertising firm's highest-regarded employee.
Marlowe, meanwhile, is miserable; she thinks she is falling in love with Hunter, but her one real true love is the man who discovered her, George Schmidlap (Groucho Marx).
Not being able to find Schmidlap, she pursues Hunter, though her Secretary "Vi" (Joan Blondell) warns her that she is playing a dangerous game.
(Ironically, Blondell, who plays Mansfield's frumpy, middle-aged, all-business secretary, was herself a major movie sex symbol some 30 years before, and whose sexuality was one of the first victims of the Hays Code).
Hunter soon finds fame to be a double-edged sword, getting him what he wants, but with a price to be paid for that success.
Women are crazy about him, and he has no peace of mind.
Ultimately, he moves up the ladder at work, becoming company president, only to find it is not what he really wanted.
Hunter confesses to his angry fiancée Jenny that he finds himself at the top of the heap without any meaning and she takes him back.
As Rita Marlowe opens her television spectacular for Stay-Put Lipstick, she is surprised by the appearance of the show's "surprise" guest star of (and the first real love of her life), George Schmidlap.
Freed from strain of advertising, Rock and Jenny retire to the country to tend a chicken farm, announcing that he has found the real living end.

Woman of the Year

Tess Harding (Katharine Hepburn) and Sam Craig (Spencer Tracy) are journalists for the fictional New York Chronicle, with two drastically different backgrounds and worlds.
Tess is an educated, well-travelled political affairs columnist who speaks several languages fluently.
Sam is a knowledgeable and informed sports writer.
Their difficulties are presented as stemming from class and emotional differences as well as from those of gender.
A feud in their columns erupts over baseball, and their editor tells them that he will not stand for an intramural feud at his paper.
Sam invites Tess on a date to a baseball game, and she inadvertently breaks the "men only" atmosphere of the press box.
She is confused and unfamiliar with the rules of the sport.
Tess then invites Sam to her apartment later that night.
What he thought would be a romantic occasion is actually a dinner party where none of the guests is speaking, or can speak, English.
Despite the seemingly wide differences between their lives and personalities, the two fall in love.
After Sam and Tess marry, a conflict arises over Tess's priorities and Sam's place in her life.
They have several minor disagreements about not being together enough, but a bigger problem occurs when Tess volunteers to take on the care of a Greek refugee child, Chris (George Kezas), without consulting Sam.
Tess is excited but trepidatious about Sam's reaction.
He initially believes Tess is pregnant when she announces they're having a child.
Upon meeting Chris, however, he is angry and doesn't want an unrelated six-year-old orphan.
Still, he tries to befriend the boy and introduces him to sports.
Tess learns that she has received the award of "America's Outstanding Woman of the Year", to be awarded at a gala ceremony.
She plans to leave Chris by himself.
When Sam finds out, he refuses to leave Chris alone, though Tess wants him to be beside her on her big night, and is embarrassed at the thought that the public will wonder where he is.
Sam says she can tell everyone he had more important plans.
Tess offends him by asking if anyone would believe he could find something more important to do.
While Tess is at her ceremony, Sam returns the child to the orphanage and walks out on Tess.
She learns of this upon her return home, when she goes to change for photographers – only to discover that Sam and Chris and their belongings are all gone.
She attempts to reclaim Chris, but he refuses, preferring to stay with his fellow refugees.
The next day, Tess receives an invitation, addressed to both of them, to the home of her prominent Senator father (Minor Watson) and the world-famous feminist aunt who raised her (Fay Bainter).
Sam is covering a championship boxing match that evening and tells her he cannot go.
Tess arrives alone, only to be told that her aunt and her father are to be married that night, after 15 years of "making the same mistake" and saying nothing of their mutual attraction.
Listening to the words of the wedding ceremony encourages Tess to attempt a reconciliation with Sam.
Tess enters Sam's Riverside home the next morning and starts to prepare breakfast.
Eventually awakened by her noisy incompetence in the kitchen, he watches her surreptitiously.
She proclaims her intention of being nothing more than his wife and thinking only of his domestic needs, but he believes it is an insincere tactic to win him back.
Trying to prove herself, Tess once again tries to cook breakfast, only to fail because she knows nothing of cooking.
Sam tells her this is the first time he is disappointed in her, faulting her for going to extremes.
He says he does not want Tess Harding or "just mrs Sam Craig," but instead "Tess Harding Craig".
Tess happily agrees, and they reconcile.
Gerald, Tess' ultra-competent secretary (Dan Tobin), arrives with a bottle of champagne and reminds Tess of her commitment to launch a ship.
Sam takes Gerald outside, the bottle smashes, and Sam returns, claiming to have "launched" Gerald.

Here Comes Mr. Jordan

On 11th May 1941, Boxer and amateur pilot Joe Pendleton (Robert Montgomery), affectionately known as "the Flying Pug", flies his small aircraft to his next fight in New York City, but crashes when a control cable severs.
His soul is "rescued" by 7013 (Edward Everett Horton), an officious angel who assumed that Joe could not have survived.
Joe's manager, Max "Pop" Corkle (James Gleason), has his body cremated.
In the afterlife, the records show his death was a mistake; he was supposed to live for 50 more years.
The angel's superior, mr Jordan (Claude Rains), confirms this, but since there is no more body, Joe will have to take over a newly dead corpse.
mr Jordan explains that a body is just something that is worn, like an overcoat; inside, Joe will still be himself.
Joe insists that it be someone in good physical shape, because he wants to continue his boxing career.
Joe keeps saying the body they find "has to be in the pink".
After Joe turns down several "candidates", mr Jordan takes him to see the body of a crooked, extremely wealthy banker and investor named Bruce Farnsworth, who has just been drugged and drowned in a bathtub by his wife Julia (Rita Johnson) and his secretary, Tony Abbott (John Emery).
Joe is reluctant to take over a life so unlike his previous one, but when he sees the murderous pair mockingly berating Miss Logan (Evelyn Keyes), the daughter of a financier who was sold worthless bonds by Farnsworth's bank, he changes his mind and agrees to take over Farnsworth's body.
As Farnsworth, Joe repays all the investors, including Miss Logan's father.
He sends for Corkle and convinces him that he is Joe (by playing his saxophone just as badly as he did in his previous incarnation).
With Farnsworth's money to smooth the way, Corkle trains him and arranges a bout with the current heavyweight champion, but mr Jordan returns to warn Joe that, while he is destined to be the champion, it cannot happen that way.
Joe has just enough time to tell Miss Logan, with whom he's fallen in love, that if a stranger (especially if he is a boxer) approaches her, to give him a chance.
Then he is shot by his secretary.
The body is hidden, and Joe returns to a ghostly existence.
Accompanied by mr Jordan, Joe finds that his replacement in the prizefight with the champ is a clean-cut, honest fighter named Murdoch, whom Joe knows and respects.
Finding that he has forgotten his lucky saxophone, Joe runs back to the Farnsworth mansion to find that everyone believes Farnsworth has "disappeared".
Corkle has hired a private investigator to find him.
Corkle explains about Joe, mr Jordan and the body-switching, but of course the police detective (Donald MacBride) thinks he is a nut.
Joe manages to mentally nudge Corkle into turning on the radio to the fight and hears that Murdoch has collapsed without even being touched.
mr Jordan reveals that the boxer was shot by gamblers because he refused to throw the fight.
Joe takes over Murdoch's body and wins the title.
Back at the mansion, Corkle hears one of the radio announcers mention a saxophone hanging by the ringside and realizes Joe has assumed Murdoch's body.
Corkle races down to the dressing room.
There, Joe passes along information from mr Jordan that Farnsworth's body is in a refrigerator in the basement of the mansion.
Corkle tells the detective, who promptly has mrs Farnsworth and the secretary arrested.
As Murdoch, Joe fires his old, crooked manager and hires Corkle.
mr Jordan reveals to Joe that this is his destiny; he can be Murdoch and live his life.
Healing the gunshot wound and at the same time removing Joe's memory of his past life, mr Jordan hangs around for a bit longer until Miss Logan arrives.
She wanted to see Corkle, but runs into Murdoch instead.
The pair feel they have met before.
The two go off together, while mr Jordan smiles and says "So long, champ".

The More the Merrier

Retired millionaire Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn) arrives in Washington,C.
as an adviser on the housing shortage and finds that his hotel suite will not be available for two days.
He sees an ad for a roommate and talks the reluctant young woman, Connie Milligan (Jean Arthur), into letting him sublet half of her apartment.
Then Dingle runs into Sergeant Joe Carter (Joel McCrea), who has no place to stay while he waits to be shipped overseas.
Dingle generously rents him half of his half.
When Connie finds out about the new arrangement, she orders them both to leave, but she is forced to relent because she has already spent the men's rent.
Joe and Connie are attracted to each other, though she is engaged to bureaucrat Charles Pendergast (Richard Gaines).
Connie's mother married for love, not security, and Connie is determined not to repeat her mistake.
Dingle happens to meet Pendergast at a business luncheon and does not like what he sees.
He decides that Joe would be a better match for his landlady.
One day, Dingle goes too far, reading aloud to Joe from Connie's private diary, including her thoughts about Joe.
When she finds out, she demands they both leave the next day.
Dingle takes full blame for the incident.
Connie allows Joe to remain in the apartment as he has only a few days before being shipped out to Africa.
Joe asks Connie to go out with him.
She is reluctant to do so, but decides to go if Pendergast does not call for her by 8.
At 8, she and Joe are ready to leave, but her noisy teenage neighbor seeks her advice and delays her until Pendergast arrives.
Joe spies on the two of them from the window.
When the neighbor asks what he is doing, Joe flippantly tells him he is a Japanese spy.
Dingle calls Joe to meet him for dinner.
Dingle bumps into the couple and pretends he is meeting Connie for the first time, forcing Joe to do the same.
Dingle engages Pendergast in talk about his work, eventually maneuvering him up to his room so that Connie and Joe can be alone together.
Joe takes Connie home.
The two talk about their romantic pasts and even kiss.
From their separate rooms, Joe confesses that he loves her.
She tells him she feels the same way, but refuses to marry him, as they will soon be forced apart.
Their talk is interrupted by the arrival of the FBI, who have been called to investigate Joe for spying, thanks to the neighbor.
Joe and Connie are taken to headquarters.
They identify Dingle as a fellow occupant who can testify that they are only roommates.
Dingle arrives, bringing Pendergast as a character witness.
It comes out during questioning that Joe and Connie live at the same address.
When they ask mr Dingle to tell Pendergast that their living arrangement is purely innocent, he denies knowing them.
Outside the station, Dingle admits he lied to protect his reputation.
Taking a taxi home, they discuss what to do to avoid a scandal.
Connie grows angry when Pendergast thinks only of himself.
When another passenger in the shared cab turns out to be a reporter, Pendergast runs after him to try to stop him from writing about their situation.
Dingle assures Connie that if she marries Joe, the crisis will be averted, and they can get a quick annulment afterwards.
The couple follow his advice and wed.
Returning home, Connie allows Joe to spend his final night in her apartment.
As Dingle had foreseen, Connie's attraction to Joe overcomes her prudence.
Outside, Dingle puts up a card, showing that the apartment belongs to mr and mrs Sgt.
Carter.

The Bishop's Wife

Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven), troubled with funding the building of a new cathedral, prays for divine guidance.
His plea is seemingly answered by a suave angel named Dudley (Cary Grant), who reveals his identity only to the clergyman.
However, Dudley's mission is not to help construct a cathedral, but to spiritually guide Henry and the people around him.
Henry has become obsessed with raising funds, to the detriment of his family life.
His relationships with Julia (Loretta Young) and their young daughter are strained by his focus on the cathedral.
Everyone, except for Henry, is charmed by Dudley, even the non-religious Professor Wutheridge (Monty Woolley).
Dudley persuades the wealthy parishioners, particularly widowed Agnes Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), to contribute needed funds, but not to build the cathedral.
He coaxes mrs Hamilton to donate her money to feed and clothe the needy — much to Henry's chagrin.
To save time, Dudley also redecorates the Broughams' Christmas tree in a few seconds, saves an old church by restoring interest in the boys' choir, and dictates to a typewriter to magically produce Henry's new sermon — without Henry's knowledge.
But when Dudley spends time cheering up Julia, there is an unexpected development: Dudley finds himself strongly attracted to her.
Sensing this, Henry becomes jealous and anxious for his unwelcome guest to finish and depart.
He reveals Dudley's true identity to Professor Wutheridge, who urges him to stand up and fight for the woman he loves.
Dudley indicates a willingness to stay, but Julia, sensing what he means, tells Dudley it is time for him to leave.
Dudley tells the bishop it is rare for an angel to envy a mortal.
Henry wants to know why his cathedral plans were derailed.
Dudley reminds the bishop he prayed for guidance, not a building.
With his mission completed and knowing that Julia loves her husband, Dudley leaves, promising never to return.
All memory of him is erased, and later that Christmas Eve at midnight, Henry delivers the sermon that he believes he has written.
Dudley observes from the street, satisfied that his work is done.

Shakespeare in Love

In 1593 London, William Shakespeare is a sometime player in the Lord Chamberlain's Men and poor playwright for Philip Henslowe, owner of The Rose Theatre.
Shakespeare is working on a new comedy, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.
Suffering from writer's block, he has barely begun the play, but starts auditioning players.
Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, who has seen Shakespeare's plays at court, disguises herself as "Thomas Kent" to audition, then runs away.
Shakespeare pursues Kent to Viola's house and leaves a note with the nurse, asking Thomas Kent to begin rehearsals at the Rose.
He sneaks into the house with the minstrels playing that night at the ball, where her parents are arranging her betrothal to Lord Wessex, an impoverished aristocrat.
While dancing with Viola, Shakespeare is struck speechless, and after being forcibly ejected by Wessex, uses Thomas Kent as a go-between to woo her.
Wessex also asks Will's name, to which he replies that he is Christopher Marlowe.
When he discovers her true identity, they begin a secret affair.
Inspired by her, Shakespeare writes quickly, with help from his friend and rival playwright Christopher 'Kit' Marlowe, completely transforming the play into what will become Romeo and Juliet.
Then, Viola is summoned to court to receive approval for her proposed marriage to Lord Wessex.
Shakespeare accompanies her, disguised as her female cousin.
There, he persuades Wessex to wager £50 that a play can capture the true nature of love, the exact amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the Chamberlain's Men.
Queen Elizabeth I declares that she will judge the matter when the occasion arises.
When Richard Burbage, owner of the Curtain, finds out that Shakespeare has cheated him out of both money and the play, he goes to the Rose Theatre with his Curtain Theatre Company and starts a brawl.
The Rose Theatre company drives Burbage and his company out and then celebrate at the local pub.
Viola is appalled when she learns Shakespeare is married, albeit separated from his wife, and she realises she cannot escape her duty to marry Wessex.
Will discovers that Marlowe is dead, and thinks he is to blame.
Lord Wessex suspects an affair between Shakespeare and his bride-to-be.
Because Wessex thinks that Will is Kit Marlowe, he approves of Kit's death, and tells Viola the news.
It is later learned that Marlowe had been killed in an accident.
Viola finds out that Will is still alive, and declares her love for him.
When Edmund Tilney, the Master of the Revels, is informed there is a woman player at The Rose, he closes the theatre for breaking the ban on women.
Viola's identity is exposed, leaving them without a stage or lead actor, until Richard Burbage offers them his theatre.
Shakespeare takes the role of Romeo, with a boy actor as Juliet.
Following her wedding, Viola learns that the play will be performed that day, and runs away to the Curtain.
Planning to watch with the crowd, Viola overhears that the boy playing Juliet cannot perform, and offers to replace him.
While she plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo, the audience is enthralled, despite the tragic ending, until Master Tilney arrives to arrest everyone for indecency due to Viola's presence.
But the Queen is in attendance and restrains Tilney, instead asserting that Kent's resemblance to a woman is, indeed, remarkable.
However, even a queen is powerless to end a lawful marriage, and she orders Kent to "fetch" Viola because she must sail with Wessex to the Colony of Virginia.
The Queen also tells Wessex, who followed Viola to the theatre, that Romeo and Juliet has won the bet for Shakespeare, and has Kent deliver his £50 with instructions to write something "a little more cheerful next time, for Twelfth Night".
Viola and Shakespeare say their goodbyes, and he vows to immortalise her, as he imagines the beginnings of Twelfth Night, imagining her as a castaway disguised as a man after a voyage to a strange land.

Getting inside the circle, Sally and the townswomen reenact her oath with Gillian.
They are able to break the Owens curse, exorcising Jimmy's spirit and allowing the coven to exile him permanently.
Sally receives a letter from Gary telling her that she and her sister are cleared of any suspicion of wrongdoing in Jimmy's case and Gary returns to Massachusetts to be with Sally.

The band, which also includes a bass player (Ethan Embry), adopts the name "The Oneders" (pronounced "wonders", but often mispronounced "oh-NEE-ders").
At the talent show, Guy launches into a faster tempo than intended for Jimmy's ballad, "That Thing You Do", and the band wins the competition.
The Oneders' performance at the talent show earns them a paying gig at a local restaurant, where they begin to sell recordings of "That Thing You Do" and are noticed by talent promoter Phil Horace (Chris Ellis), whom they hire as their manager.
Horace achieves radio airplay for the song and books the band at a rock & roll showcase concert in Pittsburgh, after which they are offered a contract by Play-Tone Records A&R representative mr White (Hanks).
White changes the band's name to "The Wonders" as they join a Midwestern Play-Tone tour, taking along Jimmy's girlfriend, Faye (Liv Tyler) as their official "costume mistress".
During the tour, "That Thing You Do" garners national radio airplay and becomes a bona-fide hit.
As the band's popularity soars, Jimmy grows frustrated that the group is not focused on creating more music, while the remainder of the band enjoys their time in the spotlight.
All the while, Guy and Faye grow closer as friends.
When the song enters the top ten on the Billboard charts, the band is taken off the tour and sent to Los Angeles.
Faye falls ill on the trip and is nursed by Guy.
Jimmy is seemingly uninterested in her well-being, being preoccupied with trying to convince White to let the band record more of his original songs.
After a publicity tour, the band is set to appear on The Hollywood Television Showcase, a nationally-televised live variety show.
They begin to show signs of discord.
Jimmy continues to vent frustration at White over the band's direction.

During the performance, as the band is being visually introduced to the viewing audience, the caption "Careful girls, he's engaged.
" appears under Jimmy's name.
Jimmy becomes upset with Faye in the dressing room afterward, and says that he has no intention of marrying her.
Heartbroken and weary with his arrogant personality and lack of devotion, Faye terminates their relationship.
The next day at a scheduled recording session, Lenny is missing, and Jimmy's grievances with White reach a boiling point and he quits the band.
Guy is sorry to see the end of the band.
White confronts him, and declares the band a one-hit wonder, but commends Guy for his smarts and integrity.
After an impromptu jam session with his idol, jazz pianist Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), Guy returns to the band's hotel, where he meets Faye and shares a long kiss with her.
In an epilogue, it is revealed that Jimmy went back to Play-Tone and forms another band (The Heardsmen) and has a successful career as an artist and producer, Lenny becomes a casino manager, and the bass player earns a Purple Heart for injuries suffered at Khe Sanh.

Prizzi's Honor

Charley Partanna is a hit man for a New York crime organization headed by the elderly Don Corrado Prizzi, whose business is generally handled by his sons Dominic and Eduardo and by his longtime right-hand man, Angelo, who is Charley's father.
At a family wedding, Charley is quickly infatuated with a beautiful woman he doesn't recognize.
He asks Maerose Prizzi, estranged daughter of Dominic, if she recognizes the woman, oblivious to the fact that Maerose still has feelings for Charley, having once been his lover.
Maerose is in disfavor with her father for running off with another man after the end of her romance with Charley.
Charley discovers that the mysterious woman, Irene, is a "contractor" who, like himself, performs assassinations for the mob.
He flies to California to spend time with her and quickly falls in love.
Unaware she is married, Charley also carries out a contract to kill Irene's husband, Marksie Heller, for robbing a Nevada casino.
She repays some of the money Marksie stole and in Mexico marries Charley.
Charley is unaware that Irene is suspected by the mob of having the rest of the money Marksie took.
A jealous Maerose travels there on her own to establish for a fact that Irene has double-crossed the organization.
The information restores Maerose to good graces somewhat with her father and the don.

Hannah and Her Sisters

The story is told in three main arcs, with most of it occurring during a 24-month period beginning and ending at Thanksgiving parties hosted by Hannah (Mia Farrow) and her husband, Elliot (Michael Caine).
Hannah serves as the stalwart hub of the narrative; most of the events of the film connect to her.
Elliot becomes infatuated with one of Hannah's sisters, Lee (Barbara Hershey), and eventually begins an affair with her.
Elliot attributes his behavior to his discontent with his wife's self-sufficiency and resentment of her emotional strength.
Lee has lived for five years with a reclusive artist, Frederick (Max von Sydow), who is much older.
She finds her relationship with Frederick no longer intellectually or sexually stimulating, in spite of (or maybe because of) Frederick's professed interest in continuing to teach her.
She leaves Frederick after he discovers her affair with Elliot.
For the remainder of the year between the first and second Thanksgiving gatherings, Elliot and Lee carry on their affair despite Elliot's inability to end his marriage to Hannah.
Lee finally ends the affair during the second Thanksgiving, explaining that she is finished waiting for him to commit and that she has started dating someone else.
Hannah's ex-husband Mickey (Woody Allen), a television writer, is present mostly in scenes outside of the primary story.
Flashbacks reveal that his marriage to Hannah fell apart after they were unable to have children because of his infertility.
However, they had twins who are not biologically his, before divorcing.
He also went on a disastrous date with Hannah's sister Holly (Dianne Wiest) when they were set up after the divorce.
A hypochondriac, he goes to his doctor complaining of hearing loss, and is frightened by the possibility that it might be a brain tumor.
When tests prove that he is perfectly healthy, he is initially overjoyed, but then despairs that his life is meaningless.
His existential crisis leads to unsatisfying experiments with religious conversion to Catholicism and an interest in Krishna Consciousness.
Ultimately, an unsuccessful suicide attempt leads him to find meaning in his life after unexpectedly viewing the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup in a movie theater.
The revelation that life should be enjoyed, rather than understood, helps to prepare him for a second date with Holly, which this time blossoms into love.
Holly's story is the film's third main arc.
A former cocaine addict, she is an unsuccessful actress who cannot settle on a career.
After borrowing money from Hannah, she starts a catering business with April (Carrie Fisher), a friend and fellow actress.
Holly and April end up as rivals in auditions for parts in Broadway musicals, as well as for the affections of an architect (Sam Waterston).
Holly abandons the catering business after the romance with the architect fails and decides to try her hand at writing.
The career change forces her once again to borrow money from Hannah, a dependency that Holly resents.
She writes a script inspired by Hannah and Elliot, which greatly upsets Hannah.
It is suggested that much of the script involved personal details of Hannah and Elliot's marriage that had been conveyed to Holly through Lee (having been transmitted first from Elliot).
Although this threatens to expose the affair between Elliot and Lee, Elliot soon disavows disclosing any such details.
Holly sets aside her script, and instead writes a story inspired by her own life, which Mickey reads and admires greatly, vowing to help her get it produced and leading to their second date.
A minor arc in the film tells part of the story of Norma (Maureen O'Sullivan) and Evan (Lloyd Nolan).
They are the parents of Hannah and her two sisters, and still have acting careers of their own.
Their own tumultuous marriage revolves around Norma's alcoholism and alleged affairs, but the long-term bond between them is evident in Evan's flirtatious anecdotes about Norma while playing piano at the Thanksgiving gatherings.
By the time of the film's third Thanksgiving, Lee has married someone she met while taking classes at Columbia, while Hannah and Elliot have reconciled their marriage.
The film's final shot reveals that Holly is married to Mickey and that she is pregnant.

A Room with a View

The first part of the novel is set in Florence, Italy, and describes a young English woman's first visit to Florence, at a time when upper middle class English women were starting to lead independent, adventurous lives.
Lucy Honeychurch is touring Italy with her overbearing older cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett, and the novel opens with their complaints about the hotel, "The Pension Bertolini".
Their primary concern is that although rooms with a view of the River Arno have been promised for each of them, their rooms instead look over a courtyard.
A mr Emerson interrupts their "peevish wrangling," offering to swap rooms as he and his son, George Emerson, look over the Arno.
This behaviour causes Miss Bartlett some consternation, as it appears impolite.
Without letting Lucy speak, Miss Bartlett refuses the offer, looking down on the Emersons because of their unconventional behaviour and thinking it would place her under an "unseemly obligation" towards them.
However, another guest at the pension, an Anglican clergyman named mr Beebe, persuades the pair to accept the offer, assuring Miss Bartlett that mr Emerson only meant to be kind.
The next day, while Charlotte rests in the pension, Lucy decides to spend a "long morning" in the Basilica of Santa Croce, led by another guest, Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who promises her an adventure.
The older woman immediately takes away Lucy's Baedeker guidebook, which, she says, only touches the surface of things.
She will show Lucy the "true Italy".
But on the way to Santa Croce, chattering away, the two take a wrong turn and get lost.
After drifting for hours through various streets and piazzas, they finally make it back to the square in front of the church only to have the novelist abandon Lucy in pursuit of an old man who, she says, is her "local colour box".
Inside the church, Lucy meets the Emersons again.
Although their manners are awkward and they are deemed socially unacceptable by the other guests, Lucy likes them and continues to run into them in Florence.
One afternoon Lucy witnesses a murder in Florence.
George Emerson happens to be nearby and catches her when she faints.
Lucy asks George to retrieve some photographs of hers that happen to be near the murder site.
George, out of confusion, throws her photographs into the river because they were spotted with blood.
Lucy observes how boyish George is.
As they stop to look over the River Arno before making their way back to the hotel, they have an intimate conversation.
After this, Lucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings and partly to keep her cousin happy—Miss Bartlett is wary of the eccentric Emersons, particularly after a comment made by another clergyman, mr Eager, that mr Emerson "murdered his wife in the sight of God".
Later on in the week, a party made up of Beebe, Eager, the Emersons, Miss Lavish, Miss Bartlett and Lucy Honeychurch make their way to Fiesole, in carriages driven by Italians.
The driver is permitted to invite a woman he claims is his sister onto the box of the carriage, and when he kisses her, mr Eager promptly forces the lady to get off the carriage box.
mr Emerson remarks how it is defeat rather than victory to part two people in love.
In the fields, Lucy searches for mr Beebe, and asks in poor Italian for the driver to show her the way.
Misunderstanding, he leads her to a field where George stands.
George is overcome by Lucy's beauty among a field of violets and kisses her, but they are interrupted by Lucy's cousin, who is outraged.
Lucy promises Miss Bartlett that she will not tell her mother of the "insult" George has paid her because Miss Bartlett fears she will be blamed.
The two women leave for Rome the next day before Lucy is able to say goodbye to George.
In Rome, Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England.
Cecil proposes to Lucy twice in Italy; she rejects him both times.
As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned to Surrey, England to her family home, Windy Corner.
Cecil proposes yet again at Windy Corner, and this time she accepts.
Cecil is a sophisticated and "superior" Londoner who is desirable in terms of rank and class, even though he despises country society; he is also somewhat of a comic figure in the novel, as he gives himself airs and is quite pretentious.
The vicar, mr Beebe, announces that new tenants have leased a local cottage; the new arrivals turn out to be the Emersons, who have been told of the available cottage at a chance meeting with Cecil; the young man brought them to the village as a comeuppance to the cottage's landlord, whom Cecil thinks to be a snob.
Fate takes an ironic turn as Lucy's brother, Freddy, meets George and invites him to bathe in a nearby pond.
Freddy, George and Mr Beebe go to the pond, in the woods, take off their clothes and swim.
They enjoy themselves so much they end up running around the pond and through the bushes, until Lucy, her mother, and Cecil arrive, having taken a short-cut through the woods.
Freddy later invites George to play tennis at Windy Corner.
Although Lucy is initially mortified at the thought of facing both George and Cecil (who is also visiting Windy Corner that Sunday), she resolves to be gracious.
Cecil annoys everyone by pacing around and reading aloud from a light romance novel that contains a scene suspiciously reminiscent of when George kissed Lucy in Florence.
George catches Lucy alone in the garden and kisses her again.
Lucy realises that the novel is by Miss Lavish (the writer-acquaintance from Florence) and that Charlotte must thus have told her about the kiss.
Furious with Charlotte for betraying her secret, Lucy forces her cousin to watch as she tells George to leave and never return.
George argues with her, saying that Cecil only sees her as an "object for the shelf" and will never love her enough to grant her independence, while George loves her for who she is.
Lucy is moved but remains firm.
Later that evening, after Cecil again rudely declines to play tennis, Lucy sours on Cecil and immediately breaks off her engagement.
She decides to flee to Greece with acquaintances from her trip to Florence, but shortly before her departure she accidentally encounters mr Emerson senior.
He is not aware that Lucy has broken her engagement with Cecil, and Lucy cannot lie to the old man.
mr Emerson forces Lucy to admit out loud that she has been in love with his son George all along.
The novel ends in Florence, in melodramatic fashion, where George and Lucy have eloped without her mother's consent.
Although Lucy "had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever," the story ends with the promise of lifelong love for both her and George.
In some editions, an appendix to the novel is given entitled "A View without a Room," written by Forster in 1958 as to what occurred between Lucy and George after the events of the novel.
It is Forster's afterthought of the novel, and he quite clearly states that "I cannot think where George and Lucy live".
They were quite comfortable up until the end of World War I, with Charlotte Bartlett leaving them all her money in her will, but the war ruined their happiness according to Forster.
George became a conscientious objector, lost his government job but was given non-combatant duties to avoid prison, leaving Mrs Honeychurch deeply upset with her son-in-law.
Mr Emerson died during the course of the war, shortly after having an argument with the police about Lucy continuing to play Beethoven (a German composer) on the piano during the war.
Eventually they had three children, two girls and a boy, and moved to Carshalton from Highgate to find a home.
Despite their wanting to move into Windy Corner after the death of Mrs Honeychurch, Freddy sold the house to support his family as he was "an unsuccessful but prolific doctor".
After the outbreak of World War II, George immediately enlisted as he saw the need to stop Hitler and the Nazi regime, but was not faithful to Lucy during his time at war.
Lucy was left homeless after her flat in Watford was bombed and the same happened to her married daughter in Nuneaton.
George rose to the rank of corporal but was taken prisoner by the Italians in Africa.
Once the Fascist government in Italy fell, George returned to Florence finding it "in a mess" but he was unable to find the Pension Bertolini, stating "the View was still there and that the room must be there, too, but could not be found".
Forster ends by stating that George and Lucy await World War III, but with no word on where they live, for even he does not know.

Moonstruck

Thirty-seven-year-old Loretta Castorini (Cher), a Sicilian-American widow, is a bookkeeper in Brooklyn Heights, New York, where she lives with her family: her father Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) a successful plumber; her mother Rose (Olympia Dukakis); and her paternal grandfather (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr).
Her boyfriend Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to be with his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death.
Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding.
Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement.
Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the "real" wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves.
The next day, Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery.
He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fiancée; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fiancée left him.
Loretta insists that they discuss the matter upstairs in his apartment, where she cooks for him and then tells him that she believes he is a "wolf" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship.
Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then carrying her to his bed where they make love.
At the same time, Cosmo is dining with his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette) and giving her jewelry.
That evening, Rose's brother Raymond (Louis Guss) and his wife Rita (Julie Bovasso) join Rose and Cosmo for dinner, and they all wonder where Loretta is.
Raymond recalls that when he was a boy and Cosmo was courting Rose, he thought that a particularly bright moon one night was somehow brought to the house by Cosmo because of his love for Rose.
That night, Loretta remains at Ronny's apartment and sees such a moon; Raymond sees it as well, and it leads him and Rita to make love.
The next morning, Loretta tells Ronny they can never see each other again.
She slaps him when he claims to be in love with her ("Snap out of it.
") and he agrees to never see her again if she will attend the opera (his other great love) with him that night.
She agrees.
She then goes to church and confesses her infidelity.
She unexpectedly sees her mother there, and Rose tells her that Cosmo is having an affair; Loretta is doubtful.
Loretta then goes to Raymond and Rita's store to close out the cash register, after which she impulsively goes to the hair salon and buys a glamorous evening gown.
Loretta and Ronny (wearing a tuxedo) meet at Lincoln Center, and each is impressed with the other's appearance.
Loretta is deeply moved by her first opera, Puccini's La bohème.
But as they leave, Loretta sees Cosmo and Mona, and she confronts her father.
He sees that she is with Ronny, and he suggests that they simply agree that they didn't see each other at all, but Loretta is conflicted.
Loretta then intends to return home alone, but Ronny leads her back to his apartment where he passionately and desperately persuades her into another tryst.
The same night, Rose dines alone at a restaurant and sees a college professor, Perry (John Mahoney), being dramatically dumped by a female student, a similar scene having played out with a different girl the night Johnny proposed to Loretta.
Rose invites Perry to dine with her, asks him why men pursue women, and then shares with him her belief that men pursue women because they fear death.
Perry walks Rose home and tries to convince her to invite him in; she refuses "because I'm married.
Because I know who I am".
Later, Johnny unexpectedly returns from Sicily after his mother's "miraculous" recovery and goes to Loretta's house; Rose explains that she's not there and then asks him why men chase women.
He tells her it may be because they fear death, with which Rose agrees.
After this exchange he leaves, planning to return in the morning to see Loretta.
In the morning, Loretta returns home in a reverie but is then distressed to learn from Rose that Johnny will be there soon.
Ronny then arrives, and Rose notes their matching "love bites" and invites him for breakfast over Loretta's objections.
Cosmo and his father emerge from upstairs, and the older man cajoles Cosmo into agreeing to pay for Loretta's wedding.
Rose then confronts Cosmo and, after he acknowledges in response to her questioning that she has been a good wife, demands that he end his affair; he is upset but agrees and, after insistence from Rose, also agrees to go to confession, and they then affirm their love for each other.
Raymond and Rita also arrive, concerned and seemingly reluctantly suspicious, to find out why Loretta didn't make the previous day's bank deposit; they are relieved to learn that she merely forgot and still has the money.
When Johnny finally arrives, he breaks off the engagement, superstitiously believing that their marriage would cause his mother's death.
Loretta, momentarily offended by his breaking the engagement, chastises Johnny for breaking his promise and throws the engagement ring at him.
Seizing the moment, Ronny borrows the ring and asks Loretta to marry him; she accepts.
To Rose's chagrin, Loretta declares that she loves Ronny.
The family toasts the couple with champagne and a befuddled Johnny joins in at the grandfather's urging, as he will now be part of the family after all.

Working Girl

Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) is an Irish American working-class stockbroker's secretary from Staten Island with a bachelor's degree in Business from evening classes.
She aspires to reach an executive position.
Tricked by her boss (Oliver Platt) into a date with his lascivious colleague (Kevin Spacey), she gets into trouble by publicly insulting him and is reassigned as secretary to a new financial executive, Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver).
Seemingly supportive, Katharine encourages Tess to share ideas.
Tess suggests that a client, Trask Industries, should invest in radio to gain a foothold in media.
Katharine listens to the idea and says she'll pass it through some people.
Later, she says the idea wasn't well received.
But when Katharine breaks her leg skiing in Europe, she asks Tess to house-sit.
While at Katharine's place, Tess discovers some meeting notes where Katharine plans to pass off the merger idea as her own.
At home, Tess finds her boyfriend (Alec Baldwin) in bed with another woman.
Disillusioned, she returns to Katharine's apartment and begins her transformation.
Tess sets up a meeting with executive Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), using her boss's name as an entrée.
She wants to see Trainer the evening before the meeting at a party, which she will attend in a dress of Katharine's.
Before the party, when Tess suffers a panic attack, her friend Cynthia (Joan Cusack) gives her a valium from Katharine's bathroom.
At the party, Tess unknowingly meets Jack, who is fascinated by her.
They have a couple of drinks, and the combined effect of valium and alcohol lead to her waking next morning in Jack's bed.
She leaves before he wakes and, entering the meeting, realizes Jack Trainer is the man she had spent the night with.
She feels the pitch goes badly.
Back at her desk, she is mortified about the night before, but Jack comes in and says they are happy with Tess's idea.
Days later, Tess and Jack gatecrash Trask's (Philip Bosco) daughter’s (Barbara Garrick) wedding and pitch their plan.
Trask is interested, and a meeting is set up.
Later, Tess and Jack end up in bed together.
Tess wants to explain her true situation but keeps quiet after learning Jack has been in a relationship with Katharine, which he says is all but over.
Katharine comes home on the day of the meeting with Trask.
Tess overhears Katharine asking Jack to confirm his love for her, but he avoids answering and hurries out.
Tess also rushes off, leaving her appointment book, which Katharine reads.
The meeting goes well until Katharine storms in, accusing Tess, a mere secretary, of having stolen her idea.
Tess protests but leaves, apologizing.
Days later, Tess clears out her desk and then bumps into Jack, Katharine, and Trask in front of the lobby elevators.
Tess confronts Katharine and starts to tell everyone her side of the story.
Katharine tries to lead the group away, but Jack says he believes Tess.
When Trask hears a convincing tidbit, he hops off the closing elevator, leaving Katharine still in the lift.
Trask gets on another elevator with Jack and Tess, where Tess then gives her elevator pitch to Trask, telling him the roundabout way in which she came up with the idea for the merger.
When they get to their office floor, Trask confronts Katharine, asking her how she came up with the idea.
She stumbles and balks and can't really explain where the idea came from.
Katharine is fired on the spot for her fraud, and Trask offers Tess an "entry-level" job with his company.
Tess starts her new job, armed with a lunchbox prepared by Jack.
Directed to an office, she sees a woman on the phone, assumes she is her new boss, and seats herself in the typing pool.
The woman (Amy Aquino) reveals that she is, in fact, Tess’s secretary and that Tess is the new junior executive for whom she is working.
Tess insists they work together as colleagues, showing she will be very different from Katharine.
She then calls Cynthia from her office overlooking Manhattan to say she's landed her dream job.

As Good as It Gets

Melvin Udall is a misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City.
He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts.
He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs.
He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly, the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior.
One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop, is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery.
Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs, into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized.
Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it.
He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol.
When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog.
Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spencer ("Spence").
Unable to adjust to another waitress, Melvin arranges through his publisher, whose husband is a doctor, to pay for her son's considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work.
She is overwhelmed at his generosity, and they agree there will be no physical relationship.
Meanwhile, Simon's assault and rehabilitation, coupled with Verdell's preference for Melvin, causes Simon to lose his creative muse.
Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills.
Frank convinces him to go to Baltimore to ask his estranged parents for money.
Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself, Melvin reluctantly agrees to do so – Frank lends Melvin the use of his Saab 900 convertible for the trip.
Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness.
She reluctantly accepts the invitation, and relationships among the three develop.
Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out to have dinner.
Melvin's comments during the dinner greatly flatter—and subsequently upset—Carol, and she abruptly leaves.
Upon seeing the frustrated Carol, Simon begins to sketch her semi-nude in his hotel room and rekindles his creativity, once more feeling a desire to paint.
He briefly reconnects with his parents, but is able to tell them that he'll be fine.
After returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore.
She later regrets her statement and calls him to apologize.
The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon (whom Melvin has allowed to move in with him until he can fully heal from his injuries and get a new apartment) convinces Melvin to declare his love for her.
Melvin goes to see Carol, who is hesitant, but agrees to try and establish a relationship with him.
The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together.
As he opens the door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol, he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement, but doesn't seem to mind.

Moulin Rouge!

In the year 1900, a British writer named Christian (Ewan McGregor), suffering from depression, begins writing on his typewriter ("Nature Boy").
As Christian narrates, the film flashes back to one year earlier upon Christian's move to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement.
He soon discovers that his neighbours are a loose troupe of performers led by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo).
Toulouse-Lautrec and the others ask for Christian's help, and his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, "Spectacular Spectacular", that they wish to sell to the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent).
The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his "Diamond Dog Dancers" perform for the audience ("Zidler's Rap Medley").
Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine (Nicole Kidman), the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh), a potential investor in the cabaret ("Sparkling Diamonds").
Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things confidentially ("Rhythm of the Night", "Meet Me in the Red Room"), but soon learns he is just a writer ("Your Song").
The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for "Spectacular Spectacular".
With Zidler's help, Toulouse and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil maharajah attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who loves a poor sitar player ("The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)").
The Duke backs the show on the condition that only he may see Satine.
Satine contemplates on Christian and her longing to leave the Moulin Rouge to become "a real actress" ("One Day I'll Fly Away").
Christian goes back to Satine to convince her that they should be together, she eventually falls for him ("Elephant Love Medley").
As the cabaret is converted to a theater, Christian and Satine continue seeing each other under the pretense of rehearsing Satine's lines.
The Duke becomes suspicious of their frequent meetings and warns Zidler that he may stop financing the show; Zidler arranges for Satine to dine with the Duke that evening, but she falls ill from tuberculosis ("If I should die (Górecki)").
Zidler makes excuses to the Duke, claiming that Satine has gone to confession ("Like a Virgin").
Zidler learns that Satine does not have long to live.
Satine tells Christian that their relationship endangers the show, but he counters by writing a secret love song to affirm their love ("Come What May").
As the Duke watches Christian rehearsing with Satine, Nini, a jealous performer, points out that the play is a metaphor for Christian, Satine and the Duke.
Enraged, the Duke demands the ending be changed with the courtesan choosing the maharajah; Satine offers to spend the night with the Duke to keep the original ending.
At the Duke's quarters, Satine sees Christian on the streets below, and realizes she cannot sleep with the Duke.
("El Tango de Roxanne (Roxanne)").
The Duke attempts to rape her, but she is saved by Le Chocolat, one of the cabaret dancers.
Reunited with Christian, he urges her to run away with him.
The Duke tells Zidler he will have Christian killed if Satine is not his.
Zidler reiterates this warning to Satine, but when she refuses to return, he finally informs her she is dying ("A Fool to Believe").
Zidler tells Satine that to save Christian's life, she has to tell him that she will be staying with the Duke and she doesn't love him ("The Show Must Go On").
Christian tries following her, but is denied entry to the Moulin Rouge, and becomes depressed, even though Toulouse insists that Satine does love him.
The night of the show, Christian sneaks into the Moulin Rouge, intending to pay Satine to return his love just as the Duke paid for her ("Hindi Sad Diamonds").
He catches Satine before she steps on stage and demands she tell him she does not love him.
Suddenly they find themselves in the spotlight; Zidler improvises and convinces the audience that Christian is the sitar player in disguise.
Christian denounces Satine and walks off the stage.
From the rafters, Toulouse cries out, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return", spurring Satine to sing the song Christian wrote to express their love.
Christian returns to the stage, joining her in the song and reaffirming his love for her.
The Duke orders his bodyguard to kill Christian, but is thwarted, while the Duke's own attempt is stopped by Zidler.
The Duke storms out of the cabaret as Christian and Satine complete their song ("Come What May (Reprise)", "Coup d'État (Finale)").
After the curtain closes, Satine succumbs to tuberculosis.
Before she dies, Christian and Satine affirm their love and she tells him to write their story.
A year later the Moulin Rouge has closed down, and Christian finishes writing the tale of his love for Satine, a "love that will live forever" ("Nature Boy (Reprise)").

When Newman meets Oscar and Peter, he assumes that they are lovers, even though Oscar is straight.
(Peter is in fact gay, but his relationship with Oscar is strictly platonic) Under the mistaken impression that Oscar is gay, he asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress Amy (Campbell) and make sure that she doesn't talk to his wife.
Oscar falls for Amy virtually on sight, but she thinks he's gay.
He is forced to maintain the charade to avoid getting into trouble with Newman, and losing the commission.

Despite the embarrassing misconceptions, Oscar forms a close bond with Amy as they continue to spend time together-to the extent that Amy moves in with him after she is kicked out of her apartment.
At the final presentation for the cultural center, Oscar and Peter receive the commission, but Oscar is simultaneously told that he has won the award for Gay Professional Man of the Year, with Newman deciding that he will reveal his decision after the ceremony.
After an awkward meeting between Amy and Newman's wife at the party, she and Oscar go to a bar.
Amy leaves in frustration after she nearly kisses him, prompting a brief argument between her and Oscar where Oscar states that her relationship with Newman has no future.
After spending the day alone, Oscar attends the award ceremony for Gay Professional Man of the Year.
Although he initially continues his charade, while looking out at the people before him, he instead makes a passionate speech about how he admires all the men and women here who were able to tell the truth to their families about how they feel, ending the speech by "coming out of the closet" as he admits that he's straight and in love with Amy.
As he is applauded for having the courage to admit the truth, he runs after Amy, only for her to punch both him and Newman and storming out.
Peter then awkwardly accepts the prize that comes with the award: a date with Kevin.
However, as Oscar sits in a restaurant where he and Amy ate together on the night they met, Amy comes to see him.
She says that she loves him too, and they kiss.
In a post-credit sequence, Newman's wife Olivia (Kelly Rowan) convinces him to go with Oscar and Peter's design, revealing that she knew about him and Amy and informing him bluntly that Oscar and Peter did the better job.

Donovan's Reef

The film begins with Thomas "Boats" Gilhooley (Lee Marvin), an expatriate United States Navy veteran, working aboard a freighter.
When he realizes that the ship is passing by Haleakaloha, French Polynesia, and not actually stopping there, he jumps ship to swim to the island.
Next, Michael "Guns" Donovan (John Wayne), another expatriateS.
Navy veteran and a former shipmate of Gilhooley, returns from a fishing trip aboard an outrigger canoe.
Donovan is greeted by William "Doc" Dedham (Jack Warden), also aS.
Navy veteran and the only physician in the archipelago, who is about to begin a one or two week pre-Christmas circuit of the "outer islands," taking care of the health needs of the residents.
Dedham's three children are placed in Donovan's care.
The kids' plans for a peaceful celebration of Donovan's birthday on December 7 are shattered by the arrival of Gilhooley, who shares the same birthday.
There is an unbroken 21-year tradition that Donovan and Gilhooley have a knock-down, drag-out fight every birthday—-to the delight of the local observers-—and their 22nd year does not break the tradition.
The two vets meet in (and trash) "Donovan's Reef," the saloon owned by Donovan.
Miss Amelia Dedham (Elizabeth Allen) is a "proper" young lady "of means" from Boston, who has become the chairman of the board of the Dedham Shipping Company.
Her father is Doc Dedham, whom she has never met, but who now has inherited a large block of stock in the family company, making him the majority stockholder.
She travels to Haleakaloha in hope of finding proof that Doc has violated an outdated (but still in effect) morality clause in the will which would keep him from inheriting the stock and thus enable her to retain control.
When word reaches Haleakaloha that Miss Dedham is on the way, a scheme is concocted by Donovan, Gilhooley, and the Marquis de Lage (Cesar Romero).
De Lage is Haleakaloha's French governor, who hopes to find a post somewhere else.
Donovan is to pretend to be the father of Doc's three children (Leilani, Sarah and Luke), until Doc comes back and can explain things to the prim, proper Boston lady.
The plan is reluctantly accepted by the oldest daughter, Leilani, who believes the deception is because she and her siblings are not white.
The plan works, and Amelia is told that her father, Donovan and Gilhooley were marooned on the Japanese-occupied island after their destroyer was sunk in World War II.
With the help of the locals, the three men conducted a guerrilla war against the Japanese.
She also learns that her father built a hospital, and lives in a large house (she had obviously expected to find a shack).
A mystery develops as she enters the house and sees a portrait of a beautiful Polynesian woman in royal trappings.
This was Doc's wife, the mother of his children.
Amelia is not told of the relationship, but she learns that the woman was named Manulani.
Donovan mentions that Luke's mother had died in childbirth.
As the story develops, Amelia learns that life in the islands is not as she expected, and neither is Donovan, who proves to be educated and intelligent, and the owner of a substantial local shipping operation.
Amelia, too, is not as expected, as when she strips off her outdated "swimming costume" to reveal a tight swimsuit, challenges Donovan to a swimming race, and dives into the water.
They develop a truce, as de Lage tries to court Amelia (or rather, her $18,000,000).
When dr Dedham returns, father and daughter meet for the first time (Amelia: "Doctor Dedham, I presume.
").
He has been told about the deception, and over dinner he explains that he was serving in World War II when his wife (Amelia's mother) died.
When the war ended, he felt that he was not needed in Boston, but was desperately needed in the islands, so he stayed.
He has even signed over his stock to Amelia, as he intends to remain in the islands.
Just as he is about to explain about Manulani and their children (described by Amelia as "half-caste"), a hospital emergency interrupts.
It turns out that Manulani was the granddaughter of the last hereditary prince of the islands, and Amelia finally puts all of the pieces together to solve the mystery.
Leilani-—Manulani's daughter-—is not only the island's princess, but Amelia's sister, a relationship which is tearfully but joyfully acknowledged by both girls.
Amelia and Donovan evolve their truce into marriage plans, despite her blaming him (correctly) for the attempt to deceive her as to her half-siblings' true paternity.
Gilhooley also finally marries his longtime girlfriend, Miss Lafleur (Dorothy Lamour).
Donovan points out the new sign on the saloon, which is now "Gilhooley's Reef".
Donovan has given the bar to his old shipmate as a wedding present.

Pretty Woman

Edward Lewis, a successful corporate raider in Los Angeles on business, accidentally ends up on Hollywood Boulevard in the city's red-light district, after breaking up with his girlfriend during an unpleasant phone call in which he appears highly controlling; he asks her to escort him during his trip, but she is offended that he treats her as his 'beck and call girl'.
Leaving a party, he takes his lawyer's Lotus Esprit luxury car, and encounters a prostitute, Vivian Ward.
He stops for her, having difficulties driving the car, and asks for directions to Beverly Hills.
He asks her to get in and guide him to the Beverly Hills Regent Hotel, where he is staying.
It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive.
Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate.
She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; later, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as paying for a new, more acceptable wardrobe for her.
That evening, visibly moved by her transformation, Edward begins seeing Vivian in a different light.
He begins to open up to her, revealing his personal and business lives.
Edward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal.
His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met.
Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished.
Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement.
Edward apologizes, and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate to whom Vivian paid attention at the match.
Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways.
Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian in his private jet to see La Traviata in San Francisco.
Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man; after the opera, they appear to have fallen in love.
Vivian breaks her "no kissing on the mouth" rule (which her friend Kit taught her), and he offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets.
Hurt, she refuses, says this is not the "fairy tale" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.
Meeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of "raiding," Edward changes his mind.
His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests working together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces.
Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but finds only Vivian.
Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her.
Edward arrives, punches him in the face, and throws him out.
With his business inA.
complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him -- because she wants to, not because he's paying her.
She refuses.
On his way to the airport, Edward re-thinks his life and has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from out the white limo's sun roof and "rescues her," an urban visual metaphor for the knight on a white horse of her dreams.

You've Got Mail

Kathleen Kelly is involved with Frank Navasky, a leftist newspaper writer for The New York Observer who is always in search of an opportunity to root for the underdog.
While Frank is devoted to his typewriter, Kathleen prefers her laptop and logging into her AOL email account.
Using the screen name 'Shopgirl', she reads an email from "NY152", the screen name of Joe Fox whom she first met in an "over-30s" chatroom.
As her voice narrates her reading of the email, she reveals the boundaries of the online relationship; no specifics, including no names, career or class information, or family connections.
Joe belongs to the Fox family which runs Fox Books — a chain of mega bookstores.
Kathleen runs the independent bookstore "The Shop Around The Corner" that her mother ran before her.
The two are shown passing each other on their respective ways to work, revealing that they frequent the same neighborhoods in upper west Manhattan.
Joe arrives at work, overseeing the opening of a new Fox Books in New York City with the help of his best friend, branch manager Kevin.
Kathleen and her three store assistants, George, Aunt Birdie and Christina open up her small shop that morning.
Following a day with his eleven-year-old aunt Annabel and four-year-old half-brother Matthew, Joe enters Kathleen's store to let his younger relatives experience story time.
Joe and Kathleen have a conversation that reveals Kathleen's fears about the Fox Books store opening around the corner.
He omits his last name and makes an abrupt exit with the children.
At a publishing party for New York book business people later that week, Joe and Kathleen meet again, where Kathleen discovers Joe's true identity.
She accuses him of deception and spying, while he responds by belittling her store.
The Shop Around the Corner slowly goes under.
Kathleen enters Fox Books to discover the true nature of the store is one of friendliness and relaxation, yet without the same dedication to children's books as her shop.
Her employees move on to other jobs; as Christina goes job hunting, George gets a job at the children's department at a Fox Books store and Birdie retires.
They are exchanging emails without knowing each others' true identities - and their respective significant-others' knowledge.
In some chance meetings Fox at first conceals his identity and then they clash, without realizing who each is.
When they decide to meet, Joe discovers who he has been corresponding with.
At first he decides not to meet with her, but then to meet with her without revealing his on-line identity, but they again clash.
Joe soon resumes the correspondence, apologizes, and promises to eventually tell her why he stood her up.
After both break up with their significant others, Joe realizes his feelings towards Kathleen, and begins building a face-to-face relationship, still keeping his on-line identity a secret.
He arranges a meeting between Kathleen and his on-line persona (along with his dog Brinkley), but just before she is to meet this on-line friend, he reveals his feelings for her.
Upon arriving at the agreed meeting place, she hears Fox calling to Brinkley, who has run ahead, and sees that her on-line friend is really Fox, and that she loves him, too.

Anna Karenina

Anna Karenina is the tragic story of a married aristocrat/socialite and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky.
The story starts when she arrives in the midst of a family broken up by her brother's unbridled womanizing—something that prefigures her own later situation, though she would experience less tolerance by others.
A bachelor, Vronsky is eager to marry her if she will agree to leave her husband Karenin, a senior government official, but she is vulnerable to the pressures of Russian social norms, the moral laws of the Russian Orthodox Church, her own insecurities, and Karenin's indecision.
Although Vronsky and Anna go to Italy, where they can be together, they have trouble making friends.
Back in Russia, she is shunned, becoming further isolated and anxious, while Vronsky pursues his social life.
Despite Vronsky's reassurances, she grows increasingly possessive and paranoid about his imagined infidelity, fearing loss of control.
A parallel story within the novel is that of Konstantin Levin, a wealthy country landowner who wants to marry Princess Kitty, sister to Dolly and sister-in-law to Anna's brother Oblonsky.
Konstantin has to propose twice before Kitty accepts.
The novel details Konstantin's difficulties managing his estate, his eventual marriage, and his personal issues, until the birth of his first child.
The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately thousand pages.
Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class.
The novel is divided into eight parts.
Its epigraph is Vengeance is mine, I will repay, from , which in turn quotes from.
The novel begins with one of its most often-quoted lines: The novel opens with a scene that introduces Prince Stepan Arkadyevich Oblonsky ("Stiva"), a Moscow aristocrat and civil servant who has been unfaithful to his wife Princess Darya Alexandrovna ("Dolly").
Dolly has discovered his affair with the family's governess, and the household and family are in turmoil.
Stiva informs the household that his married sister, Princess Anna Arkadyevna Karenina, is coming to visit from Saint Petersburg.
Meanwhile, Stiva's childhood friend, Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin ("Kostya"), arrives in Moscow with the aim of proposing to Dolly's youngest sister, Princess Katerina Alexandrovna Shcherbatskaya ("Kitty").
Levin is a passionate, restless, but shy aristocratic landowner who, unlike his Moscow friends, chooses to live in the country on his large estate.
He discovers that Kitty is also being pursued by Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, an army officer.
Whilst at the railway station to meet Anna, Stiva bumps into Vronsky who is there to meet his mother, the Countess Vronskaya.
Anna and Vronskaya have traveled and talked together in the same carriage.
As the family members are reunited, and Vronsky sees Anna for the first time, a railway worker accidentally falls in front of a train and is killed.
Anna interprets this as an "evil omen".
Vronsky, however, is infatuated with her.
Anna is uneasy about leaving her young son, Sergei ("Seryozha"), alone for the first time.
At the Oblonsky home, Anna talks openly and emotionally to Dolly about Stiva's affair and convinces her that Stiva still loves her despite the infidelity.
Dolly is moved by Anna's speeches and decides to forgive Stiva.
Kitty, who comes to visit Dolly and Anna, is just eighteen.
In her first season as a debutante, she is expected to make an excellent match with a man of her social standing.
Vronsky has been paying her considerable attention, and she expects to dance with him at a ball that evening.
Kitty is very struck by Anna's beauty and personality and becomes infatuated with her just as Vronsky is.
When Levin proposes to Kitty at her home, she clumsily turns him down, believing she is in love with Vronsky and that he will propose to her, and encouraged to do so by her mother who believes Vronsky would be a better match (in contrast to Kitty's father, who favors Levin).
At the big ball Kitty expects to hear something definitive from Vronsky, but he dances with Anna, choosing her as a partner over a shocked and heartbroken Kitty.
Kitty realizes that Vronsky has fallen in love with Anna and has no intention of marrying her, despite his overt flirtations.
Vronsky has regarded his interactions with Kitty merely as a source of amusement and assumes that Kitty has acted for the same reasons.
Anna, shaken by her emotional and physical response to Vronsky, returns at once to st Petersburg.
Vronsky travels on the same train.
During the overnight journey, the two meet and Vronsky confesses his love.
Anna refuses him, although she is deeply affected by his attentions to her.
Levin, crushed by Kitty's refusal, returns to his estate, abandoning any hope of marriage.
Anna returns to her husband, Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a senior government official, and her son Seryozha in st Petersburg.
On seeing her husband for the first time since her encounter with Vronsky, Anna realizes that she finds him unattractive, though she tells herself he is a good man.
The Shcherbatskys consult doctors over Kitty's health, which has been failing since Vronsky's rejection.
A specialist advises that Kitty should go abroad to a health spa to recover.
Dolly speaks to Kitty and understands she is suffering because of Vronsky and Levin, whom she cares for and had hurt in vain.
Kitty, humiliated by Vronsky and tormented by her rejection of Levin, upsets her sister by referring to Stiva's infidelity, saying she could never love a man who betrayed her.
Meanwhile, Stiva visits Levin on his country estate while selling a nearby plot of land.
In st Petersburg, Anna begins to spend more time in the inner circle of Princess Elizaveta ("Betsy"), a fashionable socialite and Vronsky's cousin.
Vronsky continues to pursue Anna.
Although she initially tries to reject him, she eventually succumbs to his attentions.
Karenin reminds his wife of the impropriety of paying too much attention to Vronsky in public, which is becoming the subject of gossip.
He is concerned about the couple's public image, although he believes that Anna is above suspicion.
Vronsky, a keen horseman, takes part in a steeplechase event, during which he rides his mare Frou-Frou too hard—his irresponsibility causing her to fall and break her back.
Anna is unable to hide her distress during the accident.
Before this, Anna had told Vronsky that she is pregnant with his child.
Karenin is also present at the races and remarks to Anna that her behaviour is improper.
Anna, in a state of extreme distress and emotion, confesses her affair to her husband.
Karenin asks her to break it off to avoid further gossip, believing that their marriage will be preserved.
Kitty and her mother travel to a German spa to recover from her ill health.
There, they meet the wheelchair-bound Pietist Madame Stahl and the saintly Varenka, her adopted daughter.
Influenced by Varenka, Kitty becomes extremely pious, but becomes disillusioned by her father's criticism when she learns Madame Stahl is faking her illness.
She then returns to Moscow.
Levin continues working on his estate, a setting closely tied to his spiritual thoughts and struggles.
He wrestles with the idea of falseness, wondering how he should go about ridding himself of it, and criticising what he feels is falseness in others.
He develops ideas relating to agriculture, and the unique relationship between the agricultural labourer and his native land and culture.
He comes to believe that the agricultural reforms of Europe will not work in Russia because of the unique culture and personality of the Russian peasant.
When Levin visits Dolly, she attempts to understand what happened between him and Kitty and to explain Kitty's behaviour.
Levin is very agitated by Dolly's talk about Kitty, and he begins to feel distant from Dolly as he perceives her loving behaviour towards her children as false.
Levin resolves to forget Kitty and contemplates the possibility of marriage to a peasant woman.
However, a chance sighting of Kitty in her carriage makes Levin realise he still loves her.
Meanwhile, in st Petersburg, Karenin refuses to separate from Anna, insisting that their relationship will continue.
He threatens to take away Seryozha if she persists in her affair with Vronsky.
When Anna and Vronsky continue seeing each other, Karenin consults with a lawyer about obtaining a divorce.
During the time period, a divorce in Russia could only be requested by the innocent party in an affair and required either that the guilty party confessed—which would ruin Anna's position in society and bar her from remarrying in the Orthodox Church—or that the guilty party be discovered in the act of adultery.
Karenin forces Anna to hand over some of Vronsky's love letters, which the lawyer deems insufficient as proof of the affair.
Stiva and Dolly argue against Karenin's drive for a divorce.
Karenin changes his plans after hearing that Anna is dying after the difficult birth of her daughter, Annie.
At her bedside, Karenin forgives Vronsky.
However, Vronsky, embarrassed by Karenin's magnanimity, unsuccessfully attempts suicide by shooting himself.
As Anna recovers, she finds that she cannot bear living with Karenin despite his forgiveness and his attachment to Annie.
When she hears that Vronsky is about to leave for a military posting in Tashkent, she becomes desperate.
Anna and Vronsky reunite and elope to Europe, leaving Seryozha and Karenin's offer of divorce.
Meanwhile, Stiva acts as a matchmaker with Levin: he arranges a meeting between him and Kitty, which results in their reconciliation and betrothal.
Levin and Kitty marry and start their new life on his country estate.
Although the couple are happy, they undergo a bitter and stressful first three months of marriage.
Levin feels dissatisfied at the amount of time Kitty wants to spend with him and dwells on his inability to be as productive as he was as a bachelor.
When the marriage starts to improve, Levin learns that his brother, Nikolai, is dying of consumption.
Kitty offers to accompany Levin on his journey to see Nikolai and proves herself a great help in nursing Nikolai.
Seeing his wife take charge of the situation in an infinitely more capable manner than if he were without her, Levin's love for Kitty grows.
Kitty eventually learns that she is pregnant.
In Europe, Vronsky and Anna struggle to find friends who will accept them.
Whilst Anna is happy to be finally alone with Vronsky, he feels suffocated.
They cannot socialize with Russians of their own class and find it difficult to amuse themselves.
Vronsky, who believed that being with Anna was the key to his happiness, finds himself increasingly bored and unsatisfied.
He takes up painting and makes an attempt to patronize an émigré Russian artist of genius.
However, Vronsky cannot see that his own art lacks talent and passion, and that his conversation about art is extremely pretentious.
Increasingly restless, Anna and Vronsky decide to return to Russia.
In st Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky stay in one of the best hotels, but take separate suites.
It becomes clear that whilst Vronsky is still able to move freely in Russian society, Anna is barred from it.
Even her old friend, Princess Betsy, who has had affairs herself, evades her company.
Anna starts to become anxious that Vronsky no longer loves her.
Meanwhile, Karenin is comforted by Countess Lidia Ivanovna, an enthusiast of religious and mystic ideas fashionable with the upper classes.
She advises him to keep Seryozha away from Anna and to tell him his mother is dead.
However, Seryozha refuses to believe that this is true.
Anna visits Seryozha uninvited on his ninth birthday but is discovered by Karenin.
Anna, desperate to regain at least some of her former position in society, attends a show at the theatre at which all of st Petersburg's high society are present.
Vronsky begs her not to go, but he is unable to bring himself to explain to her why she cannot attend.
At the theatre, Anna is openly snubbed by her former friends, one of whom makes a deliberate scene and leaves the theatre.
Anna is devastated.
Unable to find a place for themselves in st Petersburg, Anna and Vronsky leave for Vronsky's own country estate.
Dolly, her mother the Princess Scherbatskaya, and Dolly's children spend the summer with Levin and Kitty.
The Levins' life is simple and unaffected, although Levin is uneasy at the "invasion" of so many Scherbatskys.
He becomes extremely jealous when one of the visitors, Veslovsky, flirts openly with the pregnant Kitty.
Levin tries to overcome his feelings, but eventually succumbs to them and makes Veslovsky leave his house in an embarrassing scene.
Veslovsky immediately goes to stay with Anna and Vronsky at their nearby estate.
When Dolly visits Anna, she is struck by the difference between the Levins' aristocratic-yet-simple home life and Vronsky's overtly luxurious and lavish country estate.
She is also unable to keep pace with Anna's fashionable dresses or Vronsky's extravagant spending on a hospital he is building.
In addition, all is not quite well with Anna and Vronsky.
Dolly notices Anna's anxious behaviour and her uncomfortable flirtations with Veslovsky.
Vronsky makes an emotional request to Dolly, asking her to convince Anna to divorce Karenin so that the two might marry and live normally.
Anna has become intensely jealous of Vronsky and cannot bear it when he leaves her even for short excursions.
When Vronsky leaves for several days of provincial elections, Anna becomes convinced that she must marry him to prevent him from leaving her.
After Anna writes to Karenin, she and Vronsky leave the countryside for Moscow.
While visiting Moscow for Kitty's confinement, Levin quickly gets used to the city's fast-paced, expensive and frivolous society life.
He accompanies Stiva to a gentleman's club, where the two meet Vronsky.
Levin and Stiva pay a visit to Anna, who is occupying her empty days by being a patroness to an orphaned English girl.
Levin is initially uneasy about the visit, but Anna easily puts him under her spell.
When he admits to Kitty that he has visited Anna, she accuses him of falling in love with her.
The couple are later reconciled, realising that Moscow society life has had a negative, corrupting effect on Levin.
Anna cannot understand why she can attract a man like Levin, who has a young and beautiful new wife, but can no longer attract Vronsky.
Her relationship with Vronsky is under increasing strain, because he can move freely in Russian society while she remains excluded.
Her increasing bitterness, boredom, and jealousy cause the couple to argue.
Anna uses morphine to help her sleep, a habit she began while living with Vronsky at his country estate.
She has become dependent on it.
Meanwhile, after a long and difficult labour, Kitty gives birth to a son, Dmitri, nicknamed "Mitya".
Levin is both horrified and profoundly moved by the sight of the tiny, helpless baby.
Stiva visits Karenin to seek his commendation for a new post.
During the visit, Stiva asks Karenin to grant Anna a divorce (which would require him to confess to a non-existent affair), but Karenin's decisions are now governed by a French "clairvoyant" recommended by Lidia Ivanovna.
The clairvoyant apparently had a vision in his sleep during Stiva's visit and gives Karenin a cryptic message that he interprets in a way such that he must decline the request for divorce.
Anna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards Vronsky, whom she suspects of having love affairs with other women.
She is also convinced that he will give in to his mother's plans to marry him off to a rich society woman.
They have a bitter row and Anna believes the relationship is over.
She starts to think of suicide as an escape from her torments.
In her mental and emotional confusion, she sends a telegram to Vronsky asking him to come home to her, and then pays a visit to Dolly and Kitty.
Anna's confusion and anger overcome her and, in a parallel to the railway worker's accidental death in Part 1, she commits suicide by throwing herself under the carriage of a passing train.
Sergei Ivanovich's (Levin's brother) latest book is ignored by readers and critics and he joins the new pan-Slavic movement.
Stiva gets the post he desired so much, and Karenin takes custody of Vronsky and Anna's baby, Anna.
A group of Russian volunteers, including the suicidal Vronsky, depart from Russia to fight in the Orthodox Serbian revolt that has broken out against the Turks.
Meanwhile, a lightning storm occurs at Levin's estate while his wife and newborn son are outdoors and, in his fear for their safety, Levin realizes that he does indeed love his son as much as he loves Kitty.
Kitty's family is concerned that a man as altruistic as her husband does not consider himself to be a Christian, but after speaking at length to a peasant, Levin has a true change of heart, concluding that he does believe in the Christian principles taught to him in childhood and no longer questions his faith.
He realizes that one must decide for oneself what is acceptable concerning one's own faith and beliefs.
He chooses not to tell Kitty of the change that he has undergone, and is initially displeased that his return to his faith does not bring with it a complete transformation to righteousness.
However, at the end of the story, Levin arrives at the conclusion that despite his newly accepted beliefs, he is human and will go on making mistakes.
His life can now be meaningfully and truthfully oriented toward righteousness.

She becomes friends with the town's druggist (pharmacist), Murphy Jones (James Garner), but a romance between them seems unlikely due to Murphy's age and because Emma allows her ex-husband, Bobby Jack Moriarty (Brian Kerwin), to move back in with her and their 12-year-old son, Jake (Corey Haim).

Joe Banks is a downtrodden everyman from Staten Island, working a clerical job in a dreary factory for an unpleasant, demanding boss, Frank Waturi.
Joyless, listless and chronically sick, Banks regularly visits doctors who can find nothing wrong with him.
Finally, dr Ellison diagnoses an incurable disease called a "brain cloud", which has no symptoms, but will kill Joe within five or six months.

They believe that the fire god of the volcano on their island must be appeased by a voluntary human sacrifice once every century, but none of the Waponis are willing to volunteer this time around.
Graynamore offers to pay for whatever Joe wants to enjoy his final days, as long as he is willing to jump into the volcano within 20 days.

Theodora Goes Wild

Theodora Lynn (Irene Dunne) is a Sunday school teacher and former church organist in Lynnfield, Connecticut, raised by two spinster aunts, Mary (Elisabeth Risdon) and Elsie Lynn (Margaret McWade).
She also happens to be, under the pen name Caroline Adams, the secret author of a bestselling book that has the straight-laced Lynnfield Literary Circle in an uproar.
The book is serialized in the local newspaper, and the Literary Circle, led by outraged busybody Rebecca Perry (Spring Byington), forces the newspaper's owner Jed Waterbury (Thomas Mitchell) to stop printing the salacious installments.
Theodora travels to New York City on the pretext of visiting her black sheep Uncle John (Robert Greig), but actually goes to see her publisher Arthur Stevenson (Thurston Hall).
Though Stevenson reassures an anxious Theodora that only he and his secretary know her identity, his wife Ethel (Nana Bryant) pressures him into an introduction, which the book's illustrator Michael Grant (Melvyn Douglas) overhears.
Intrigued, Michael invites himself to dinner with the Stevensons and Theodora.
Theodora becomes annoyed when Michael smugly assumes that she is a teetotaler, so she orders a whiskey.
As the night goes on, she becomes drunk.
So does Ethel, forcing Arthur to take his wife home and leaving Theodora alone with Michael.
When he makes a pass at her, she panics and flees, much to his amusement.
Michael tracks her to her hometown, and his whistling is immediately noticed outside her house.
Because she technically is not supposed to know anyone outside of Lynnfield, he coerces her into hiring him as a gardener, thus scandalizing her aunts and providing Rebecca Perry with ample information for gossip.
Michael declares that he is going to break Theodora out of her confining routine, ignoring her protests that she likes her life just the way it is.
Despite herself, she enjoys herself when Michael makes her go berrypicking and fishing with him.
Finally, she finds the nerve to tell the disapproving women of the Literary Circle that she loves him.
When she tells Michael what she has done, he is less than thrilled.
The next day, Theodora finds that he has gone back to New York and left her.
She tracks him to his Park Avenue apartment.
He admits he loves her, but then his father (Henry Kolker), the lieutenant governor, shows up, followed by Michael's wife Agnes (Leona Maricle).
The estranged couple only have remained married to avoid causing a political scandal for Michael's father.
Theodora determines to free Michael just as he had done for her.
He wants her to hold off until his father's term ends in two years, but she is unwilling to wait that long.
She courts publicity by revealing herself as the true Caroline Adams.
She is staying in Michael's apartment even though he has moved out to get away from her, and she tells the press of her intention to publish a new book that details finding romance in her small town and searching for someone who will call her "baby" &ndash; a story that mimics her relationship with Michael.
Meanwhile, Michael denies to the press that he has even met Theodora.
She finally crashes the governor's ball and arranges for reporters to photograph her embracing Michael.
Agnes seeks a divorce to avoid looking like a fool.

Ball of Fire

A group of bachelor professors (one was a widower) have lived together for some years in a New York City residence, compiling an encyclopedia of all human knowledge.
The youngest, Professor Bertram Potts (Gary Cooper), is a grammarian who is researching modern American slang.
The professors are accustomed to working in relative seclusion at a leisurely pace with a prim housekeeper named Miss Bragg (Kathleen Howard) keeping watch over them.
Their impatient financial backer Miss Totten (Mary Field) suddenly demands that they finish their work soon.
Venturing out to do some independent research, Bertram becomes interested in the slang vocabulary of saucy nightclub performer "Sugarpuss" O'Shea (Barbara Stanwyck).
She is reluctant to assist him in his research until she needs a place to hide from the police, who want to question her about her boyfriend, mob boss Joe Lilac (Dana Andrews).
Sugarpuss takes refuge in the house where the professors live and work, despite Bertram's objections and their housekeeper's threat to leave because of her.
In the meantime, Lilac decides to marry her, but only because as his wife she would not be able to testify against him.
The professors soon become enamored of her femininity, and she begins to grow fond of them.
She teaches them to conga and demonstrates to Bertram the meaning of the phrase "yum yum" (kisses).
She becomes attracted to Bertram, who reciprocates with a vengeance by proposing marriage to her.
She avoids giving an answer to the proposal, and agrees to Lilac's plan to have the professors drive her to New Jersey to marry Lilac.
After a series of misadventures, including a car crash, Sugarpuss realizes that she is in love with the Professor, but is forced to go ahead with her marriage to Lilac to save the professors from Lilac's henchmen.
Bertram, meanwhile, unaware of Sugarpuss' love for him, prepares to resume his research, sadder but wiser, until he discovers her true feelings.
The professors eventually outwit Lilac and his henchmen and rescue Sugarpuss.
She decides she is not good enough for Bertram, but his forceful application of "yum yum" convinces her to change her mind.

Irma la Douce

Irma la Douce ["Irma the Sweet"] tells the story of Nestor Patou (Jack Lemmon), an honest cop, who after being transferred from the park Bois de Boulogne to a more urban neighborhood in Paris, finds a street full of prostitutes working at the Hotel Casanova and proceeds to raid the place.
The police inspector, who is Nestor's superior, and the other policemen, have been aware of the prostitution, but tolerate it in exchange for bribes.
The inspector, a client of the prostitutes himself, fires Nestor, who is accidentally framed for bribery.
Kicked off the force and humiliated, Nestor finds himself drawn to the very neighborhood that ended his career with the Paris police - returning to Chez Moustache, a popular hangout tavern for prostitutes and their pimps.
Down on his luck, Nestor befriends Irma La Douce (Shirley MacLaine), a popular prostitute.
He also reluctantly accepts, as a confidant, the proprietor of Chez Moustache, a man known only as "Moustache".
In a running joke, Moustache (Lou Jacobi), a seemingly ordinary barkeeper, tells of a storied prior life &ndash; claiming to have been, among other things, an attorney, a colonel, and a doctor, ending with the repeated line, "But that's another story".
After Nestor defends Irma against her abusive pimp boyfriend, Hippolyte, Nestor moves in with her, and he soon finds himself as Irma's new pimp.
Jealous of the thought of Irma being with other men, Nestor comes up with a plan to stop Irma's prostitution.
But he soon finds out that it is not all that it is cracked up to be.
Using a disguise, he invents an alter-ego, "Lord X", a British lord, who "becomes" Irma's sole client.
Nestor's plans to keep Irma off the streets soon backfire and she becomes suspicious, since Nestor must work long and hard to earn the cash "Lord X" pays Irma.
When Irma decides to leave Paris with the fictitious Lord X, Nestor decides to end the charade.
Unaware he is being tailed by Hippolyte, he finds a secluded stretch along the river Seine and tosses his disguise into it.
Hippolyte, not having seen Nestor change his clothes, sees "Lord X"'s clothes floating in the water, and concludes Nestor murdered him.
Before Nestor is arrested, Moustache advises him not to reveal that Lord X was a fabrication.
He tells him, "The jails are full of innocent people because they told the truth".
Nestor admits to having killed Lord X, but only because of his love for Irma.
Hauled off to jail, but with Irma in love with him, Nestor is sentenced to 15 years' hard labor.
Learning that Irma is pregnant, Nestor escapes from prison, with Moustache's help, and returns to Irma.
He narrowly avoids being recaptured when the police search for him in Irma's apartment, but donning his old uniform Nestor simply blends in with the other police.
With the help of Hippolyte, Nestor arranges for the police to search for him along the Seine from which, dressed as Lord X, he emerges.
Knowing he cannot be rearrested for a murder the police now know did not occur, Nestor rushes to the church, where he plans to marry Irma.
As she walks down the aisle she begins to experience contractions and they continue during the wedding ceremony.
Nestor and Irma barely make it through the ceremony before she goes into labor and delivers their baby.
While Nestor and everyone else is occupied with Irma, Moustache notices one of the guests sitting alone at the front of the church.
Rising from his seat and walking past Moustache, the guest is none other than Lord X.
A clearly baffled Moustache looks at Lord X, and then at the audience.
"But that's another story," he says.

The Three Musketeers

In 1625 France, d'Artagnan (a poor young nobleman) leaves his family in Gascony and travels to Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard.
At an inn in Meung-sur-Loire, an older man derides d'Artagnan's horse.
Insulted, d'Artagnan demands a duel.
The older man's companions beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword.
His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tréville, the commander of the Musketeers, is also stolen.
D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the man (who is later revealed to be the Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu, who is passing orders from the Cardinal to his spy Lady de Winter, usually called Milady de Winter or simply Milady).
In Paris, d'Artagnan visits de Tréville at the headquarters of the Musketeers, but without the letter, Tréville politely refuses his application.
He does, however, write a letter of introduction to an academy for young gentlemen which may prepare him for recruitment at a later time.
From Tréville's window, d'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street below and rushes out of the building to confront him, but in doing so he offends three Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who each demand satisfaction; D'Artagnan must fight a duel with all of them that afternoon.
As d'Artagnan prepares himself for the first duel, he realizes that Athos' seconds are Porthos and Aramis, who are astonished that the young Gascon intends to duel them all.
As d'Artagnan and Athos begin, Cardinal Richelieu's guards appear and try to arrest d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers for illegal dueling.
Although outnumbered, the four men win the battle.
D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of the Cardinal's officers and a renowned fighter.
After learning of this, King Louis XIII appoints d'Artagnan to Des Essart's company of the King's Guards and gives him forty pistoles.
D'Artagnan hires a servant (Planchet), finds lodgings, and reports to Monsieur des Essart.
Des Essart's company is a less prestigious regiment in which he must serve for two years before being considered for the Musketeers.
Shortly after, his landlord speaks to him about his wife Constance Bonacieux's kidnapping.
When she is presently released, d'Artagnan falls in love at first sight with her.
She works for Queen Anne of France, who is secretly conducting an affair with the Duke of Buckingham.
The King, Louis XIII, gave the Queen a gift of diamond studs but she gives them to her lover as a keepsake.
Cardinal Richelieu, who wants war between France and England, plans to expose the tryst and persuades the King to demand the Queen wear the diamonds to a soirée that the Cardinal is sponsoring.
Constance tries to send her husband to London but the man is manipulated by Richelieu and does not go, so d'Artagnan and his friends intercede.
En route, the Cardinal's henchmen repeatedly attack them and only d'Artagnan and Planchet reach London.
Before arriving, d'Artagnan is compelled to assault and nearly kill the Comte de Wardes, a friend of the Cardinal, cousin of Rochefort and Milady's lover.
Although Milady stole two of the diamond studs, the Duke of Buckingham provides replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris.
D'Artagnan is thus able to return a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne just in time to save her honour.
In gratitude, she gives him a beautiful ring.
Shortly afterwards, d'Artagnan begins an affair with Madame Bonacieux.
Arriving for an assignation, he sees signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and Bonacieux, acting under the orders of the Cardinal, have assaulted and imprisoned her.
D'Artagnan and his friends, now recovered from their injuries, return to Paris.
D'Artagnan meets Milady de Winter officially, and recognizes her as one of the Cardinal's agents, but becomes infatuated with her until her maid reveals that Milady is indifferent toward him.
Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be the Comte de Wardes and trysts with her.
He finds a fleur-de-lis branded on Milady's shoulder, marking her as a felon.
Discovering his identity, Milady attempts to kill him but d'Artagnan eludes her.
He is ordered to the Siege of La Rochelle.
He is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison.
In an inn, the musketeers overhear the Cardinal asking Milady to murder the Duke of Buckingham, a supporter of the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle who has sent troops to assist them.
Richelieu gives her a letter that excuses her actions as under orders from the Cardinal himself, but Athos takes it.
The next morning, Athos bets that he, d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, and their servants can hold the recaptured st Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour, for the purpose of discussing their next course of action.
They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing 22 Rochellese in total.
They warn Lord de Winter and the Duke of Buckingham.
Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England but seduces her guard, Felton (a fictionalization of the real John Felton), and persuades him to allow her escape and to kill Buckingham himself.
On her return to France, Milady hides in a convent where Constance is also staying.
The naive Constance clings to Milady, who sees a chance for revenge on d'Artagnan, and fatally poisons Constance before d'Artagnan can rescue her.
The Musketeers arrest Milady before she reaches Cardinal Richelieu.
They bring an official executioner, put her on trial and sentence her to death.
After her execution, the four friends return to the siege of La Rochelle.
The Comte de Rochefort arrests d'Artagnan and takes him to the Cardinal.
When questioned about Milady's execution, d'Artagnan presents her letter of pardon as his own.
Impressed with d'Artagnan's willfulness and secretly glad to be rid of Milady, the Cardinal destroys the letter and writes a new order, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in the Tréville company of musketeers, leaving the name blank.
D'Artagnan offers the letter to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in turn but each refuses it, Athos because it is below him, Porthos because he is retiring to marry his wealthy mistress and Aramis because he is joining the priesthood.
D'Artagnan, though heartbroken and full of regrets, gets the promotion he coveted.

Tin Cup

Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy (Kevin Costner) is a former golf prodigy who has little ambition.
He owns a driving range in West Texas, where he drinks and hangs out with his pal Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin) and their friends.
dr Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), a clinical psychologist, wants a golf lesson.
She asks Roy because he knows her boyfriend David Simms (Don Johnson), a top professional golfer.
They were both on the golf team at the University of Houston.
Roy is immediately attracted to her, but she sees through his charm and resists.
Simms shows up at Roy's trailer ahead of a local benefit tournament.
Roy thinks he is being invited to play, but Simms actually wants to hire him as a caddy (since Roy knows the course).
During the round, Roy needles Simms about "laying up" instead of having the nerve to take a 230-yard shot over a water hazard.
Simms fires back that Roy's problem is playing recklessly instead of playing the percentages.
Roy brags that he could make it, and spectators make bets among themselves.
Simms warns Roy that he'll fire him if he tries, but Roy does anyway, hitting a brilliant shot onto the green.
Simms immediately fires Roy.
To get even, Roy decides to try to qualify for theS.
Open.
He makes a play for Molly, also seeking her professional help.
Molly agrees to help Roy rebuild his self-confidence in exchange for the golf lessons.
In two qualifying rounds, with Romeo as his caddy, Roy's game is excellent but his head needs help.
Roy insists on breaking the course record, but Romeo inplores him to play safely to qualify for theS.
Open.
When Roy demands his driver, Romeo snaps it in half.
Roy asks for the 3-Wood and Romeo snaps it in half as well.
Then Roy begins snapping every club in his bag in a fit except the 7-Iron "Then there’s the 7-Iron.
I never miss with the 7-Iron" This causes Romeo to walk off the course and quit.
Roy challenges anyone to a bet that he can finish the Back-9 with only a 7-Iron and everyone reluctantly refuses, but he amazingly still manages to qualify.
He loses his car on a bet with Simms.
He persuades Romeo to caddy again, but develops a problem with his swing.
On the first day of the tournament in North Carolina he shoots a horrible 83.
Meanwhile, Molly sees Simms' unpleasant side when he arrogantly refuses a child an autograph.
Seeing that trying to change Roy is a mistake, Molly encourages him to be himself.
At her suggestion, Roy wins another wager with Simms, the leader after the first round.
With renewed confidence, "Tin Cup", a nobody from nowhere, shocks the golf world by breaking theS.
Open record for a single round by shooting a 62, thus making the cut.
His third round is also excellent and moves him into contention, but on all three rounds, he refuses to lay up on the par-5 18th hole, hitting the ball into the water hazard each time.
On the last day of the tournament, Roy, Simms, and real-life PGA Tour pro Peter Jacobsen (playing himself) are in a three-way battle to win the Open.
Jacobsen finishes with a par on 18, tied for the lead with Roy and one shot ahead of Simms.
Simms yet again lays up at the 18th hole, playing it safe, although this takes him out of championship contention.
Romeo urges that he do likewise to birdie and win theS.
Open, but is urged by Molly to "go for it".
Roy, for the 4th day in a row, takes his shot and it reaches the green, but then "a little gust from the gods"&mdash;a sudden contrary wind&mdash;starts his ball rolling back, downhill into the water hazard.
Reminiscent of his blow-up back in college when he failed to qualify for the Tour, Roy tries repeatedly to hit the same shot, not realizing that he has lost the tournament, but with the same heart-breaking result, splashing in the water hazard.
Down to his last ball and risking not only humiliation but also disqualification, he still goes for the green, and on his 12th shot, his final shot finally clears the water hazard and amazingly rolls into the hole.
After a wild celebration, Roy realizes that he has blown winning theS.
Open, but Molly re-assures him about the immortality of what just happened, "Five years from now nobody will remember who won or lost, but they're gonna remember your 12.
"  Back in Texas, Molly tells Roy that because he finished in the top 15, he automatically qualifies for next year's Open.
Molly further suggests that Roy go back to the qualifying school and get on the Tour.
Molly, who gained several clients at the tournament, prepares for a career of helping players with the mental portion of the game.
They kiss passionately as the movie ends.

Bruce Almighty

Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman.
He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him.
Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on air.
Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired.
Following a series of other misfortunes, Bruce takes out his frustration on God (Morgan Freeman), blaming Him and claiming that He is "the one who should be fired".
Bruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God.
God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly.
God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will.
Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty training his dog, getting revenge on a street gang that assaulted him earlier, exposing a woman's underwear by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace.
Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back.
Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.
After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her he made anchor (angering her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head.
He re-encounters God, who confronts Bruce about his selfish use of his powers.
He explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them.
Bruce creates a computerized system to receive the prayers and respond, but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle — even though God had stated that he is only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area — and sets the program to automatically answer Yes to every prayer.
During a party to celebrate Bruce's promotion, Susan seduces and kisses him.
When Grace arrives and sees this, she storms out; Bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and will not listen to him.
He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will.
As Bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos.
Bruce returns to God, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself.
Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, training his dog normally, and allowing Evan to have his job back.
Bruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and goes about answering prayers manually as best he can.
As he reads through them, he finds a prayer from Grace, wishing for Bruce's success and well being.
As he reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore.
A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands.
Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void.
God appears and asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy.
God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being revived — near miraculously — by the doctors.
Grace arrives and the two rekindle their relationship, later becoming engaged.
After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting but takes more pleasure in the simple stories.
Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live television.
The film ends with the doomsayer Bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be God.

To Catch a Thief

John Robie (Cary Grant) is a retired infamous jewel thief or "cat burglar", nicknamed "The Cat", who now lives in a hilltop villa in the French Riviera growing grapes and flowers.
The modus operandi of a recent series of robberies leads the police to believe that Robie is active again; they attempt to arrest him, but he gives them the slip.
Robie visits a restaurant.
The staff are his old gang from his French Resistance days, paroled based on patriotic war work as long as they keep clean.
Bertani, Foussard, and the others blame Robie, because they are currently all under suspicion while the new Cat is active.
Still, when the police arrive at Bertani's restaurant, Foussard's teenage daughter Danielle (Brigitte Auber), who has a crush on Robie, spirits him to safety.
Robie can prove his innocence if he can catch the new Cat in the act.
He enlists the aid of an insurance man, Hughson (John Williams), who reluctantly obtains a list of the most expensive jewelry owners currently on the Riviera.
Widow Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis) and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly) top the list.
Robie strikes up a friendship with them.
Jessie's delighted but Frances offers a pretense of modesty.
When Robie and Frances run into Danielle at the beach, Robie keeps up the mask of being a wealthy American tourist, despite Danielle's jealous barbs about his interest in Frances.
Frances sees through Robie's cover as an American industrialist.
She seduces him, dangling before him her jewels, teases him with steamy tales of rooftop escapades, and offers herself as an accomplice who might share his crimes.
Fireworks fill the night sky.
The next morning, Jessie discovers her jewels are gone.
Robie is accused by Frances of being merely a distraction so he could steal her mother's jewelry.
The police are called, but Robie has disappeared.
To catch the new Cat, Robie stakes out an estate at night.
He struggles with an attacker, who loses his footing and tumbles over a cliff.
It is Foussard, who dies in the fall.
The police chief publicly announces that Foussard was the jewel thief, but, as Robie points out privately in the presence of the abashed Hughson, this would have been impossible because Foussard had a wooden leg, and could not climb on rooftops.
Foussard's funeral is marred by Danielle's loud accusation that Robie is responsible for her father's death.
Outside the graveyard, Frances apologizes to Robie and confesses her love.
Robie needs to continue his search for the Cat.
He asks Frances to arrange his attendance at the masquerade ball the coming weekend, when he believes the Cat will strike again.
At the ball, Frances is resplendent in a gold gown, Robie unrecognizable behind the mask of a Moor.
The police hover nearby.
Upstairs, the cat burglar silently cleans out several jewel boxes.
When Jessie asks the Moor to go get her "heart pills", Robie's voice tips off his identity to the authorities.
Upon his return, the police wait out Frances and the Moor as they dance together all night.
Finally, Frances and the Moor go to her room, and the mask is removed: it was Hughson, a switch to conceal Robie's exit.
On the rooftop Robie lurks.
His patience is finally rewarded when he is joined by another figure in black.
But just as his pursuit begins, the police throw a spotlight on him and demand he halt.
He flees as they shoot at him, but he manages to corner his foe with jewels in hand.
Unmasked, his nemesis turns out to be Foussard's daughter, Danielle.
She slips off the roof, but Robie grabs her hand before she can fall.
He forces her to confess loudly to the police of the father-daughter involvement, and that Bertani was the ringleader of this gang.
Robie speeds back to his villa, and Frances races after to convince him that she has a place in his life and home.
He agrees, but looks less than thrilled when she says, "Mother will love it up here".

American Pie 2

After breaking up for the summer, the four friends regroup for a party held by Stifler (Seann William Scott), their overtly sex-crazed class clown and good friend.
His party is shut down thanks in part to the neighbors calling the police.
Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is inspired by his brother to make his summer with his friends count by renting a beach home.
He, Jim, Oz and Finch plan to take off to a beach house together, where they intend to spend the summer.
Kevin realizes a problem and worked out that they can only afford the house if they have a fifth member to work along with them.
Stifler takes charge of much of the organizing, often ending up leading the group in their misadventures.
Oz (Chris Klein) is miserable, being away from his girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is in Spain.
During the stay at the beach house, they proceed to start having phone sex to vent some of their loneliness, which ends up being interrupted by Stifler.
Heather later shows up early to the party, ending the short storyline that Oz is involved in.
After arriving in Grand Harbor they settle in, they manage to find work painting a house (based on the Tuition Painters franchise) in the area together, mistaking the owners for lesbians.
Jim (Jason Biggs), Stifler and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) end up performing "like for like" sexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls doing the same thing.
Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room.
The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the neighborhood.
Finally at the end of the last party, Stifler manages to have a wild threesome with the owners of the house.
After this, many concurrent stories run at the same time, some interacting with each other, others staying mainly separate.
Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is coming to visit Jim in August.
When she arrives early, Jim asks for help from band geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), humiliating himself in front of the audience when he pretends to be Petey, a mentally challenged boy who plays the trombone.
They pretend to be in a relationship so that Nadia will not expect Jim to have sex (Jim is involved in an incident involving a tube of super glue he mistook for lube; he accidentally glued his hand to his penis while watching a porno film and injured himself, leaving him wounded and unable to perform).
Jim and Michelle break the mock relationship off once he is ready to have sex with Nadia, but by then Michelle has really fallen in love with Jim, and soon Jim realizes that he has found his soul-mate in Michelle.
Nadia also realizes this and tells him, "Go, get your band geek, and I will find mine".
Jim goes and plays the trombone once more whilst Michelle is playing the flute at a major recital in order to show her that she is the one he wants to be with.
Finch has become involved in the sexual art of Tantra, and claims that through Tantra he can "make an orgasm last for days".
He is waiting for Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge), who he had sex with in the first film, hoping she will show up and be willing to do it again.
He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be his little brother Matt (Eli Marienthal), the star of later films.
He spends the night talking with a few girls, but he doesn't sleep with any of them.
The next morning, after the party, a Mercedes coupe with darkened windows turns up, Finch approaches and it turns out Stifler's Mom has come after all.
He jumps at the chance and they drive off together, Stifler not realizing until after the car has driven off that it was Finch and his mother.
After being asked, she reveals her name is Janine, but also instructs Finch to resume calling her "Stifler’s mom" as per usual.
The geeky Sherman (Chris Owen) gives up on getting anyone after he is turned down by the experienced and sharp-tongued Jessica (Natasha Lyonne), but the rejected Nadia, who wanted Jim because he was a geek, is turned on by his "Sherminator" gimmick, and they end up in bed together.
Kevin doesn't end up "getting off" with anyone, but he does seem to succeed in getting over Vicky (Tara Reid) after making advances on her throughout the film.

American Wedding

While on a date in a fancy restaurant with Michelle, Jim is ready to propose to her.
His father calls to inform him that he has the ring.
Michelle misinterprets when Jim stalls the question.
Jim's dad arrives as Jim is receiving fellatio, and a mishap grasps the restaurant's attention.
Jim proposes and Michelle accepts.
Jim wants to exclude Stifler from the wedding, having concerns that Stifler's behavior isn't socially acceptable.
When Jim is worried about learning the dance, Stifler agrees to teach Jim to dance, and over time to tone down his obnoxious personality, in exchange that he be allowed to attend the wedding and host a bachelor party.
The boys go on a road trip when they discover there is only one designer who makes the dress that Michelle wants.
They go to Chicago looking for "Leslie Sommers"; Stifler unwittingly walks into a gay bar, and his raucous behavior gets him into a dispute with several patrons.
Stifler challenges Bear to a dance-off, wins, and Bear offers to provide strippers for the bachelor party.
Leslie reveals "him"self and agrees to make the dress for Michelle.
Michelle's parents, who were initially skeptical of Jim, agree to have a preliminary dinner with him.
Michelle's younger sister, Cadence, flies in for the wedding.
Both Finch and Stifler are attracted to her, and in an effort to win her over, they each adopt the other's personality and mannerisms.
Stifler arranges the bachelor party, including strippers, for everyone at Jim's house except Jim, who unknowingly has arranged dinner with Michelle's parents there.
The party is abruptly halted by the unexpected return of the three.
With assistance from Bear, who poses as a butler named "Mr.
Belvedere", Jim nearly succeeds in keeping the activities a secret, until Michelle's mother opens a closet door and is shocked to find Kevin inside, stripped to his boxers and tied to a chair.
The boys explain that it was an attempt to make Jim seem like a hero that went wrong, and Michelle's parents accept this and tell him that if he puts that much effort into the upcoming marriage, she can give her blessing.
Michelle has doubts regarding that Jim's paternal grandmother dislikes Michelle for not being Jewish, and about Stifler's invite to the wedding.
On the night before the wedding, Stifler inadvertently disrupts the walk-in refrigerator's power supply while retrieving a bottle of champagne in an attempt to lay down Cadence.
Previously, Stifler, unaware of Cadence's presence, had revealed his true rude and obnoxious personality.
When Stifler later returns, the flowers are dead.
Enraged, Jim asks him to leave, and all the others, including Cadence, support Jim's decision.
Feeling guilty for his thoughtless behavior, Stifler convinces the florist to put together a new batch of flowers, and he enlists the help of his football players and Bear.
As a gesture of remorse, he also gives a rose to Cadence, much to the amazement of Jim and Michelle.
Moved by his actions, Cadence agrees to have sex with him in a supply closet before the ceremony, but Stifler's presence is delayed by a brief thank-you meeting Jim calls among his groomsmen, citing how he is grateful to have friends like them to back him up.
Quickly returning to the hotel, Stifler hears someone in the supply closet and steps inside, unaware that Cadence was interrupted by wedding preparations and that the ushers placed Jim's grandmother in that closet to sustain her hostility about the wedding; Stifler only realizes this upon walk-in by Finch and the ushers.
She becomes pleasant, particularly towards Stifler, making Michelle and Jim's dad unknowingly happy.
Despite the chaotic events leading up to it, Michelle and Jim get married.
At the reception, the couple dances while Stifler dances with Cadence.
Finch is sitting by himself when Stifler's mom arrives.
Although agreeing they are over each other, Stifler's mom mentions having a double suite and invites Finch to join her.
The film ends with John and Justin spying on Stifler's mom and Finch in her suite's couple-size bathtub, having oral sex.

Peggy Sue Got Married

Peggy Sue Bodell sets off for her 25-year high school reunion in 1985 with her daughter, Beth, as company.
Peggy has just separated from her high school sweetheart, now husband, Charlie, and is wary of attending the reunion because of everyone questioning her about his absence as they have been married since Peggy became pregnant right after graduation.
She arrives at the reunion and is happy to reconnect with her old best friends, Maddy and Carol.
Charlie unexpectedly arrives at the reunion, causing an awkward scene with Peggy ignoring him.
The awkwardness is ended when the event MC announces the reunion’s "king and queen".
The king is Richard Norvik, a former class geek turned billionaire inventor.
Peggy is named the queen and walks on stage, but after they wheel out the reunion cake, she faints.
When Peggy wakes, she finds herself back in the spring of 1960 during her senior year of high school, having passed out after donating blood in the school gym (where the reunion was).
She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her.
Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before.
After a rough first night, she decides to have fun with the experience and behave as if everything is normal.
However, when given the chance to break up with Charlie, she thinks it might be best since she knows how it will end.
Peggy makes friends with Richard Norvik, the class geek (and future billionaire), to figure out what is going on with her.
Charlie gets jealous when she ignores him at lunch and makes arrangements to meet Richard after school to discuss time travel with him.
When she tells him her secret, at first he thinks it's a joke.
However, she tells things about him and the world that she would not know if she were not from the future.
Although Peggy has decided to break up with Charlie (and her eyes have been on Michael Fitzsimmons given this new chance), she's the only one who wants that.
One night after a party, Peggy decides to sleep with Charlie.
He then flips out and reminds her that she had rebuffed him the weekend before and therefore believes she's playing games, then drives her home.
Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe.
As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him.
After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle.
In a field, they smoke weed and find out more about one another.
When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and will not do it again.
After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.
Michael reveals that he wants her to go with him and another woman to Utah (where polygamy is legal) so they can marry and support him while he writes.
After his revelation, she tells him he should go and to write about their night together.
In the middle of their conversation, she hears a voice she recognizes singing.
When she looks at the stage, she sees that it's Charlie and realizes that she did not know everything about him.
Michael is upset, thinks that she declined his offer for Charlie and is ready to go.
After they leave, it's shown that Charlie was singing as a audition for an agent and is rejected.
The next day when Peggy goes to talk to Charlie, he lashes out at her and she gives him a song she "wrote" for him (which ends up being "She Loves You", by The Beatles).
She then goes to Richard to say goodbye so she can stop messing up her life and everyone else's since the reason Charlie stopped singing was her becoming pregnant right before they graduated.
Richard proposes, but she refuses because she does not want to marry anyone and he has to be valedictorian.
Confused, she visits her grandparents for her birthday.
After her grandparents tell her that her grandmother can see the future, she confides her story in them.
Her grandfather and his lodge friends then try a strange séance ritual to send her back to 1985.
Peggy is then kidnapped by Charlie, leaving everyone at the Lodge thinking that the ritual worked.
He tells her that he told his dad that he gave up singing and was given 10% of the business so he can support her.
He then proposes and gives her the locket she wore at the beginning of the film.
When she looks inside, she sees baby pictures of her and Charlie, which resemble their children.
Peggy sees how much he loves her and how much she loves him, and they kiss.
They begin to make love, which would again lead to Peggy getting pregnant and marrying him.
In the next moment, Peggy is transported back to 1985.
Peggy awakes in a hospital, with Charlie at her side.
He is deeply regretful of his adultery and tells Peggy he wants her back.
When she questions him about Janet, he swears it's over.
It seems there's hope for them reconciling when Peggy looks at Charlie with new eyes and (citing a reference from her grandfather who claimed that her grandmother's strudel kept the family together) says, "I'd like to invite you over to your house for dinner on Sunday with your kids.
I'll make a strudel".

The Hotel New Hampshire

This novel is the story of the Berrys, a quirky New Hampshire family composed of a married couple, Win and Mary, and their five children.
The parents, both from the small town of Dairy, New Hampshire, fall in love while working at a summer resort hotel in Maine as teenagers.
There they meet a Viennese Jew named Freud who works at the resort as a handyman and entertainer, performing with his pet bear, State o' Maine; Freud comes to symbolize the magic of that summer for them.
By summer's end the teens are engaged, and Win buys Freud's bear and motorcycle and travels the country performing to raise money to go to Harvard, which he subsequently attends while Mary starts their family.
He then returns to Dairy and teaches at the local second-rate boys' prep school he attended, the Dairy School.
But he is unsatisfied and dreaming of something better.
Brash, self-confident beauty Franny, is the object of her sibling John's adoration.
John serves as the narrator, and is sweet, if naive.
Frank is physically and socially awkward, reserved, and homosexual; he shares a friendship with his younger sister Lilly, a small, romantic girl who has "stopped growing".
Egg, an immature little boy with a penchant for dressing up in costumes, is the baby of the family.
John and Franny are companions, seeing themselves as the most normal of the children, aware that their family is rather strange.
But, as John remarks, to themselves the family's oddness seems "right as rain".
Win conceives the idea of turning an abandoned girls' school into a hotel.
He names it the Hotel New Hampshire and the family moves in.
This becomes the first part of Irving's Dickensian-style tale.
Key plot points include Franny's rape at the hands of quarterback Chipper Dove and several of his fellow football teammates.
The actions and attitude of Chipper, with whom Franny is in love, are contrasted with those of her rescuer, Junior Jones, a black member of the team.
The death of the family dog, Sorrow, provides dark comedy as he is repeatedly "resurrected" via taxidermy, literally scaring the family's grandfather to death at one point and foiling a sexual initiation of John's at another.
John partakes in a continuing sexual/business relationship with the older hotel housekeeper, Ronda Ray, which ends when a letter arrives from Freud in Vienna, inviting the family to move to help him (and his new "smart" bear) run his hotel there.
Traveling separately from the rest of the family, the mother and Egg are killed in an airplane crash.
The others take up life in Vienna at what is renamed the (second) Hotel New Hampshire, one floor of which is occupied by prostitutes and another floor by a group of radical communists.
The family discover that Freud is now blind and the "smart bear" is actually a young woman named Susie, who has endured events which leave her with little fondness for humans and feeling most secure inside a very realistic bear suit.
After the death of his wife, Win Berry retreats further into his own hazy, vague fantasy world, while the family navigate relationships with the prostitutes and the radicals.
John and Franny experience the pain and desire of being in love with each other.
The two also feel jealousy when John becomes romantically involved with a communist who commits suicide, and Franny finds comfort, freedom and excitement in sexual relationships with Susie the bear and Ernst, the "quarterback" of the radicals.
Lilly develops as a writer and authors the story of the family, under whose noses an elaborate plot is being hatched by the radicals to blow up the opera house, using Freud and the family as hostages, which Freud and Win barely manage to stop.
The family becomes famous, and with Frank as Lilly's agent, her book is published for a large amount of money.
The family (with Susie the bear) returns to the States, taking up residence in The Stanhope hotel in New York.
In the final part of the novel, Franny and John find a way to resolve their love, and Franny, with Susie's ingenious assistance, gets revenge on her rapist.
Franny finds success as a movie actress and marries Junior Jones, now a well-known civil rights lawyer.
Lilly is unable to cope with the pressure of her career and her own self-criticism and commits suicide.
John and Frank purchase the shut-down resort in Maine where their parents met during the "magical" summer, and the property becomes another hotel of sorts, functioning as a rape crisis center run by Susie.
Susie, whose emotional pain and insecurities have healed somewhat with time and effort, builds a happy relationship with John, and a pregnant Franny asks them to raise her and Junior's impending baby.
The novel is evocative of the New Hampshire of Irving's childhood.

Cold Comfort Farm

Following the death of her parents, the book's heroine, Flora Poste, finds she is possessed "of every art and grace save that of earning her own living".
She decides to take advantage of the fact that "no limits are set, either by society or one's own conscience, to the amount one may impose on one's relatives", and settles on visiting her distant relatives at the isolated Cold Comfort Farm in the fictional village of Howling in Sussex.
The inhabitants of the farm — Aunt Ada Doom, the Starkadders, and their extended family and workers — feel obliged to take her in to atone for an unspecified wrong once done to her father.
As is typical in a certain genre of romantic 19th-century and early 20th-century literature, each of the farm's inhabitants has some long-festering emotional problem caused by ignorance, hatred, or fear, and the farm is badly run.
Flora, being a level-headed, urban woman, determines that she must apply modern common sense to their problems and help them adapt to the 20th century.

The American President

Popular Democratic President Andrew Shepherd is preparing to run for re-election.
The President and his staff, led by Chief of Staff and best friendJ.
MacInerney, attempt to consolidate the administration's 63% approval rating by passing a moderate crime control bill.
However, support for the bill in both parties is tepid: conservatives do not want it, and liberals think it is too weak.
If it passes, however, Shepherd's re-election is presumed by his staff to be a shoo-in, and Shepherd resolves to announce the bill, and the Congressional support to pass it, by the State of the Union.
With the President of France about to arrive in the United States to attend a state dinner in his honor, Shepherd—widowed when his wife died of cancer three years earlier—is placed in an awkward predicament when his cousin Judith, with whom he had planned to attend the dinner, gets sick.
The President's attention soon focuses on Sydney Ellen Wade, just hired by an environmental lobbying firm to persuade the President to pass legislation committing his Administration to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
During their first meeting, Shepherd and Wade are immediately intrigued by each other.
At this meeting, Shepherd strikes a deal with Wade: if she can secure 24 votes for the environmental bill by the date of the State of the Union, he will deliver the last 10 votes.
Whatever his personal feelings toward Wade, he expresses this to his staff, especially the pragmaticJ, as a sound political move.
He believes Wade will not be able to get enough votes to meet her side of the deal, thus releasing Shepherd from responsibility if the bill fails to pass.
Later that evening, in a series of phone calls, Shepherd invites Wade to the state dinner.
During the State dinner and subsequent occasions, the couple fall in love.
When the Republican presidential hopeful Senator Bob Rumson learns "the President's got a girlfriend," he steps up his attacks on Shepherd and Wade, focusing on Wade's activist past and maligning Shepherd's ethics and his family values.
The President refuses to respond to these attacks, which drives his approval ratings lower and costs him crucial political support, without which his crime bill seems doomed to failure.
At the White House Christmas Party, Wade is dejected about her meeting that day with three Congressmen from Michigan about the environmental bill and how it was a dismal failure; in the process, she inadvertently mentions to the President andJ.
that the Congressmen in question said the only bill they were more interested in defeating than the President's crime bill was Wade's environmental bill.
Shepherd andJ.
are conflicted by this information as Wade clearly had no idea of the implications of this casual conversation, much less that they might actually use this information in their favor and against her environmental bill.
Eventually, Wade does manage to get enough votes to meet her part of the deal.
However, in the meantime, Shepherd's team discovers he is exactly three votes short, with no other apparent options to acquire them except by shelving the environmental bill, thus solidifying the support of the three Congressmen from Michigan—which he agrees to do.
This results in disaster for Wade as she is immediately fired from her lobbyist job for failing to achieve her objectives, as well as seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation.
She visits the White House to break up with Shepherd and says that she has a job possibility in Hartford, Connecticut.
He tells her politics is making choices, his number-one has always been the crime control bill, and that he does not want to lose her over this.
She congratulates him on getting the leverage to pass a crime bill that in no way will help fight crime.
She concludes, "Mr.
President, you have bigger problems than losing me—you've just lost my vote".
On the morning that he is to deliver his State of the Union Address, and after an argument withJ, Shepherd makes a surprise appearance in the White House press room and rebuts Rumson's attacks on Wade's past and his own values and character.
He declares he will send the controversial environmental bill to Congress with a massive 20% cut in fossil fuels — far more than the 10% originally envisioned — and that he is withdrawing his support for the weak crime bill, promising to write a stronger one in due time.
In his speech he even promises gun control, in an attempt at root-and-branch solving of America's problems.
His passionate and erudite defense of those things in which he believes, in contrast to his earlier passive behavior, galvanizes the press and his staff.
Shepherd declares he is "going over to her house and I'm not leaving until I get her back", but Wade enters the Oval Office before he can leave.
The couple are reconciled and the President, accompanied by Wade, leaves to give his State of the Union Address.
The film ends with Shepherd entering the House chamber to thunderous applause.

The Sweetest Thing

In an opening scene, a group of men are interviewed regarding Christina Walters (Cameron Diaz) who introduce her as a player and a user of men in the swinging singles market.
The men include: The scene shifts back to the sexist man whose claims of Christina's lesbianism causes an entire crowd of women to attack him with baseball bats and the movie moves along, introducing Christina Walters, a successful interior designer and Courtney Rockcliffe (Christina Applegate) who is a divorce lawyer as they console their friend and roommate Jane (Selma Blair), who had recently broken up with her boyfriend Kevin, by taking her out to a dance club and cancel their plans to stay in for pizza.
At the club, Jane feels out of place and Christina grabs a man passing by to set Jane up with.
She meets Peter Donahue (Thomas Jane) who confronts Christina for her methods before disappearing for the night.
While in the bathroom with Courtney, she calls him by name, leading her to suspect that he got under Christina's skin and she is actually attracted to him which she denies.
After running into Peter again, Christina buys him a drink and they spend time together, Peter explaining that he will be attending a wedding on Saturday and he is at the club with his obnoxious, womanizing brother Roger (Jason Bateman) to celebrate.
He invites Christina and Courtney to an after-party at their hotel, but Christina goes home and later regrets not going.
The next day, Christina cannot stop talking about Peter while Jane deals with an embarrassing "cleanup" from her fun with the guy she met the night before.
In the unedited version, Jane returns to the lunch and the women talk about always complimenting men for the sizes of their penises, eventually breaking out into a restaurant-wide "Penis Song".
Courtney arranges for her and Christina to travel to Somerset where Peter's brother's wedding is to take place and they meet Jane's boyfriend as a recurring gag they indicate he is well endowed causing misery and enjoyment from Jane.
After they leave, Christina and Courtney go on a series of misadventures including an exploding toilet, a glory hole discovery, and a motorcyclist who is led to believe Christina is giving Courtney oral sex.
Meanwhile, Jane encounters her boyfriend at her retail job and is nearly caught having sex with him in the changing rooms.
When Christina and Courtney finally get to Somerset, Christina begins having second thoughts after visiting a store to replace their wet and ruined clothing only to come out in extremely gaudy, indiscreet outfits, but a series of coincidences gives her a change of heart and they go to Peter's brother's wedding.
Arriving, they discover that it is Peter, not Roger who is getting married and the pair nearly ruin the ceremonies in their attempts to escape.
Peter and his fiance then decide that they do not want to marry each other and they call off the wedding (much to her father's chagrin) while Christina returns home and back to a newly unfulfilled life of being single again.
Later, Peter finds Christina's address in the log at the store they bought their clothing in and tracks her down.
Christina, determined not to fear the commitment, kisses Peter and then walks away disappointed.
Sometime later, Courtney is dating a doctor and is clearly very attracted to him, and Peter is interviewed like the men at the beginning of the film, retelling his version of the events calling her a bitch and a player, but ultimately revealing that he and Christina are together, having gotten married and are living very happily with Jane and Courtney and Roger as well.
Whether they all live together is left ambiguous.

Agent Cody Banks

Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz), a 15-year-old high school junior, applies for a junior field ops position at the Central Intelligence Agency's SAD (Special Activities Division) after completing a training summer camp.
Answering to his handler Agent Ronica Miles, Cody is called upon a mission to find information about a scientist named dr Albert Connors.
Connors is employed by a SPECTRE type organization named ERIS led by dr Brinkman, and his henchman François Molay.
As all CIA agents are known to Brinkman's organization, the CIA uses the unknown Banks, who is placed into the prep school of dr Connors' daughter Natalie (Hilary Duff), the William Donovan Institute.
Cody soon finds he has no social skill with girls and has no time to do this while balancing his chores and homework.
The CIA decides to help by doing his chores and homework, trying to build his status, and going into the school to set him up with Natalie.
The CIA also assemble a varying team of "experts" to train Cody into how to talk to girls, and issue him with a variety of gadgets with various functions.
Eventually, Cody befriends and falls in love with Natalie after saving her from falling off a ladder while putting up a banner, and he is invited to her 16th birthday party, where he goes undercover to her father's lab.
Cody finds that dr Brinkman is planning to use nanobots — which can destroy any carbon or silicon-based substance — to destroy the world's defense systems so he can threaten anyone who opposes him.
Since the nanobots are inactive in the cold, he plans to use ice cubes to distribute them.
After Connors, dr Brinkman, and François leave the lab, Cody tries to take one of the ice cubes, only for it to melt when in his possession.
Shortly after this, Cody gets into a fight with a number of bullies, at the party.
The fight makes the school newspaper, and the CIA suspends Cody from the mission.
Meanwhile, with Connors refusing to aid him in his plans, dr Brinkman sends François and some men to catch Natalie and bring her into his base in the Cascade Mountains.
Meanwhile, disobeying orders to leave her out of it, Cody and Natalie eat ice cream at a restaurant.
Cody attempts to explain things to Natalie but François and a group of men come over to their table and fight with Cody, knocking him unconscious and taking Natalie.
Cody is removed from the mission, and his parents ground him for staying out past his curfew.
Cody gets his brother Alex to make sure his parents do not find out that he is gone by giving him the $5,000 the CIA gave him.
Knowing Natalie's location via a tracking device in a necklace he gave her as a birthday present, Cody breaks into the CIA weapons hold and steals a rocket powered snowboard and other devices to rescue Natalie.
Cody gets a ride to the top of the mountain and snowboards to the factory where Natalie is held.
On the way, he gets caught in a grove of trees as Ronica finds him using a SoloTrek XFV.
After convincing her that they need to rescue Natalie, the pair infiltrate the laboratory and Cody rescues Natalie, also explaining the truth about why he went out with her.
However, the trio are captured by Brinkman's men, although Cody quickly manages to escape.
Natalie is held hostage by dr Brinkman, who puts an ice cube with a nanobot inside on her forehead to make her father program the system.
Cody sets off a series of explosive charges he and Ronica planted throughout the base, and in the ensuing battle, Ronica fights off several of dr Brinkman's men and Natalie kills dr Brinkman by placing the ice cube with the nanobots into his mouth, causing it to melt, and the nanobots to devour him from the inside out.
Cody later defeats François and sends him to the CIA using the SoloTrek XFV, before fleeing the facility with Ronica, Natalie and dr Connors before it explodes.
Back at headquarters, the CIA welcomes Cody back to the team and congratulates him for completing the mission.
The CIA Director asks Cody if there is anything else he needs and Cody asks them if they could help Natalie get her driver's license, which she receives.
Cody and Natalie are now a couple and the film ends with them sharing their first kiss.

The Great Race

The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis) and Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon) are competing daredevils at the turn of the 20th century.
Leslie is the classic hero – always dressed in white, handsome, ever-courteous, enormously talented and successful.
Leslie's nemesis, Fate, is the traditional melodramatic villain – usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at most everyone, maniacal evil laugh, grandiose plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure.
Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey.
They design and build a new car named "The Leslie Special".
Fate builds his own race vehicle, the Hannibal Twin-8, complete with hidden devices of sabotage.
Others cars enter in the race, including New York City's most prominent newspaper.
Driving the newspaper's car is beautiful photojournalist Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood), a vocal suffragette.
The seven-car race begins, but Fate's long-suffering sidekick Maximilian Meen (Peter Falk) has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race.
The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal mechanic Hezekiah Sturdy (Keenan Wynn), Maggie DuBois driving a Stanley Steamer by herself, and Fate and Max.
The newspaper's car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special.
Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Boracho.
A local outlaw named "Texas Jack" (Larry Storch) becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay (Dorothy Provine) and a saloon brawl ensues.
Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest.
Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and "wanted to go back to New York".
The two remaining cars reach the Bering Strait and park side-by-side in a blinding snowstorm.
Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors.
Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate's car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie's car.
They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended Russian port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who in turn casts off Maggie for deceiving him.
Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead.
After driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Pottsdorf, whose alcoholic and foppish Crown Prince Hapnick (also played by Lemmon) is a double for Fate.
Rebels under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe (Ross Martin) and General Kuhster (George Macready) kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie.
Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others.
Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom.
Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe's henchmen and confront Von Stuppe.
Following a climactic sword duel with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it.
Leslie and Max return the real Prince in time for his coronation and depart with Fate and Maggie.
Fate takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake.
A pie fight ensues involving the racers, the Prince's men and the conspirators.
As the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie's car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris.
Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have a spirited argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships.
Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the Eiffel Tower to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race.
Fate drives past to claim the winner's mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win.
Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York.
The return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team.
Fate lets them start first, then attempts to destroy their car with a small cannon.
In the final scene, the cannon misfires, knocking down the Eiffel Tower.

The Love Bug

In 1968, Jim Douglas is a down-on-his luck racing driver, reduced to competing in demolition derby races against drivers half his age.
Jim lives in an old fire house overlooking San Francisco Bay with his friend and mechanic, Tennessee Steinmetz, a jolly Brooklynite who constantly extols the virtues of spiritual enlightenment, having spent time amongst Buddhist monks in Tibet, and builds "art" from car parts.
After yet another race ends in a crash (and Tennessee turns his Edsel into a sculpture), Jim finds himself without a car and heads into town in search of some cheap wheels.
He is enticed into an upmarket European car showroom after setting eyes on an attractive sales assistant and mechanic, Carole Bennett.
Jim witnesses the dealership's British owner, Peter Thorndyke, being unnecessarily abusive towards a white Volkswagen Beetle that rolls into the showroom, and defends the car's honor, much to Thorndyke's displeasure.
The following morning Jim is shocked to find that the car is parked outside his house and that Thorndyke is pressing charges for grand theft.
A heated argument between Jim and Thorndyke is settled when Carole persuades Thorndyke to drop the charges if Jim buys the car on a system of monthly payments.
Jim soon finds the car is prone to going completely out of his control and believes Thorndyke has conned him.
Tennessee, however, believes certain inanimate objects to have hearts and minds of their own and tries to befriend the car, naming it Herbie.
Jim's feelings about his new acquisition soon improve when it appears Herbie is intent on bringing him and Carole together.
He also discovers Herbie to have an incredible turn of speed for a car of his size and decides to take him racing.
After watching Jim and Herbie win their first race together, Thorndyke, himself a major force on the local racing scene, offers to cancel the remaining payments Jim owes on Herbie if Jim can win a race that they will both be competing in at Riverside later that month.
Jim accepts, and despite Thorndyke's underhanded tactics, he and Herbie take victory.
Over the next few months they go on to become the toast of the Californian racing circuit, while Thorndyke suffers increasingly humiliating defeats.
Thorndyke finally snaps, and persuades Carole to take Jim out on a date while he sneaks round to Jim's house.
After getting Tennessee drunk on his own Irish coffee recipe, Thorndyke proceeds to tip the remainder of the alcoholic coffee and whipped cream into Herbie's gas tank.
At the following day's race, an apparently hungover Herbie shudders to a halt and backfires while Thorndyke blasts to victory.
However, as the crowd admires Thorndyke's victory, Herbie blows some whipped cream out of his exhaust pipe, covering Thorndyke.
That evening, Jim returns home in a brand new Lamborghini 400GT, having agreed to sell Herbie to Thorndyke to pay the remaining installments he owes on it.
Jim states he needs a "real car" for the upcoming El Dorado road race, but finds no sympathy from Tennessee, Carole, or Herbie, who jealously proceeds to damage the sleek sports car, proving to Jim once and for all he has a mind of his own.
By the time Thorndyke arrives to collect Herbie, he is nowhere to be found, and Jim sets off into the night hoping to find Herbie and make amends before the car is seized by Thorndyke's goons.
After narrowly escaping being torn apart in Thorndyke's workshop, and a destructive spree through Chinatown, during the Chinese New Year's parade, Herbie is about to launch himself off the Golden Gate Bridge when Jim reaches him.
In his attempt to stop Herbie from driving off the bridge, Jim nearly falls into the water.
Herbie pulls Jim back to safety, but then is impounded by the San Francisco Police Department.
There, Tang Wu, (Benson Fong) a Chinese businessman whose store was damaged during Herbie's rampage, demands compensation that Jim can no longer afford.
Using the Chinese he learned while in Tibet, Tennessee tries to reason with Wu, and learns that he is a huge racing fan who knows all about Jim and Herbie's exploits.
Wu is willing to drop the charges in exchange for becoming Herbie's new owner.
Jim agrees to this, as long as Wu allows him to race the car in the El Dorado.
If Jim wins, Wu will be able to keep the prize money, but has to sell Herbie back for a dollar.
Wu replies to this proposal in clear English: "Now you speak my language.
"  The El Dorado runs through the Sierra Nevada mountains from Yosemite Valley to Virginia City and back.
Before the start of the race, Thorndyke persuades Wu to make a wager with him on its outcome.
Thorndyke (with his assistant Havershaw acting as co-driver) pulls every trick in the book to ensure he and his Thorndyke Special are leading at end of the first leg of the race.
As a result of Thorndyke's shenanigans, Jim (with Carole and Tennessee as co-drivers) limps home last with Herbie missing two wheels and having to use a wagon wheel to get to the finish line.
Despite Tennessee's best efforts, it looks as if Herbie will be unable to start the return leg of the race the following morning.
Thorndyke then arrives and claims that this makes him the new owner of the car.
Wu regretfully tells Jim of the wager and that in accordance with its terms this is true.
Thorndyke, thinking he is Herbie's new owner, gloats to Jim about what he's going to do to Herbie and kicks Herbie's front fender, and punches Jim, but Herbie then unexpectedly lurches into life and chases Thorndyke from the scene, showing he is more than willing to race on.
Thanks to some ingenious shortcuts, Jim is able to make up for lost time in the second leg and is neck and neck with Thorndyke as they approach the finish line.
In the ensuing dogfight, Herbie's hastily welded-together body splits in two.
The back half (carrying Tennessee and the engine) crosses the line just ahead of Thorndyke, while the front (carrying Jim and Carole) rolls over the line just behind, meaning Herbie takes both first and third place.
In accordance with the terms of the wager, Wu takes over Thorndyke's car dealership (hiring Tennessee as his assistant), while Thorndyke and Havershaw are relegated to lowly mechanics.
Meanwhile, a fully repaired Herbie chauffeurs the newlywed Jim and Carole away on their honeymoon.

My Best Friend's Wedding

Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts), a 27-year-old New York City restaurant critic, receives a call from her lifelong friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney).
In college, the two made an agreement that if neither of them were married by the time they turned 28, they would marry each other.
Three weeks before her 28th birthday, Michael tells her that in four days, he will marry Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz), a 20-year-old University of Chicago student from a wealthy family.
Julianne is disappointed that Michael will marry someone so wrong for him, and someone he has known for such a short time.
She realizes that she is in love with Michael, and heads to Chicago, intent on sabotaging his wedding.
Soon after arriving she meets Kimmy, who asks her to be the maid of honor.
This sets off a subplot in which Julianne must pretend to be the dutiful maid of honor while secretly scheming ways to prevent the wedding from happening.
She engages in petty sabotage—for example, taking Kimmy and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimmy is a terrible singer—and later asks her gay friend and editor George Downes (Rupert Everett) to pretend they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous.
When these tactics fail, George persuades Julianne to do the obvious: tell Michael she is in love with him.
One morning, Michael gets Julianne alone and tells her that it'll be the last time they ever get to be alone.
He expresses some skepticism in marrying Kimmy, explaining that he and Kimmy don't share a special song like he and Julianne do.
Michael discreetly gives Julianne the invitation to tell him she's in love with him, but she lets the opportunity pass.
Michael starts singing their song as he grabs Julianne and holds her while they dance one last time.
Julianne's unauthorized use of Kimmy's father's computer to forge an email message to Michael's employer causes further problems for Michael and Kimmy, to the point where they are on the verge of calling off the wedding.
The next morning, the day of the wedding, Julianne tries to sabotage the situation further; as Michael and Kimmy are not speaking to each other, they communicate through Julianne, not realizing she is trying to manipulate them into breaking up for good.
In spite of this, Michael and Kimmy decide they do love each other and want to get married after all.
Julianne and Michael then take a walk, with Julianne finally confessing her love to Michael.
She asks him to marry her instead, and passionately kisses him.
Kimmy witnesses this, and runs off, but Michael chases her.
Julianne pursues Michael, but finally realizes he loves Kimmy.
Julianne finds Michael at Chicago Union Station, where he is looking for Kimmy, and confesses all to him.
Despite his anger at her deception, Michael forgives Julianne, and they split up to look for Kimmy.
Julianne then tracks down Kimmy in the bathroom of Comiskey Park (Kimmy's family has a private viewing box at the stadium).
Kimmy, rightly furious with Julianne, confronts her, while the other women watch, immediately siding with Kimmy and are disgusted with Julianne's dirty tactics.
Julianne, however, apologizes and explains to Kimmy that she kissed Michael unexpectedly, but he didn't kiss her back because he was in love with Kimmy.
Julianne declares that Kimmy has won, and that she accepts Michael's decision.
Kimmy and Julianne reconcile with each other while the witnesses applaud.
After the wedding, at the reception, Julianne tells Michael that he and Kimmy can use their special song until they find one of their own, essentially acting like a true best friend.
Julianne wishes them well, and she and Michael share their goodbyes, both of them finally moving on with their lives.
Later, Julianne is surprised by George showing up at the wedding reception.
The movie ends with the two of them happily sharing a dance together.

Meanwhile, Ted decides he still wants to reconnect with Mary and, assisted by Dom, drives down to Florida and discovers the truth about her.
Ted seems to have won Mary's love, until an anonymous letter exposes his connection with Healy, and she breaks contact with him.
Ted confronts Healy and Tucker, and Mary is accosted by Dom, who is revealed to be her former boyfriend "Woogie," who "got weird on her" back in college, stealing all her shoes.
When Mary is finally together with all of her deceitful suitors, Ted realizes that the only one who did not resort to lying and manipulation to win Mary was Brett, who turns out to be NFL quarterback Brett Favre.
After reuniting Brett and Mary, Ted leaves tearfully until Mary chases after Ted, saying that she would be happiest with him.
The film concludes with the two engaging in a kiss while a guitarist (Jonathan Richman), who periodically narrated the story in song throughout the film, is accidentally shot by Magda's boyfriend, who was trying to shoot Ted so he could win over Mary.

America's Sweethearts

Film publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) is tasked with promoting a film featuring movie stars Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack).
His job is complicated by the fact that the eccentric director of the film, Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken), refuses to show him a cut of the film and demands the first viewing take place at a press junket.
To promote the film, Lee decides to focus on the two stars: Gwen and Eddie, once known as "America's Sweethearts".
Unfortunately, they are now going through an ugly split.
As a result of Gwen's affair with Hector (Hank Azaria), Eddie has an emotional breakdown and is at a New Age retreat.
Lee decides that his best chance to promote the film is to reunite the couple.
He tries to get them to attend the junket, playing on Gwen's ego by telling her she will look better to the press and her fans if she attends (and she will be able to serve Eddie with divorce papers).
Lee bribes the retreat owner with a car to convince Eddie to come.
Gwen's sister and personal assistant, Kiki (Julia Roberts), and Gwen's lover (Hector) are also involved.
When Eddie sees Kiki at the junket she has lost weight and is now physically attractive.
As the junket begins, Eddie and Gwen are forced together as well as Kiki and Hector.
Gwen encourages Kiki to be her go-between with Eddie so she can have some alone time with Hector.
Eddie and Kiki begin to warm to each other.
At first, Gwen is oblivious, but eventually discovers Kiki's feelings for Eddie.
Out of her own desire to maintain her career by convincing the press that they are trying to reconcile, Gwen tries to prevent a blossoming relationship between Kiki and Eddie with her manipulation.
She succeeds in hurting Kiki's feeling and causing her to eat again.
However, Gwen's behavior enrages Eddie who always seen past her for the person she is and also sees his marriage for what it really is.
He admits to Lee that he's in love with Kiki and has always liked her for the person she is inside and out.
Realizing this along with how unhappy Eddie was with Gwen, Lee encourages him to tell Kiki and end his marriage to Gwen anyway.
When the film is shown, the press, cast and crew discover that Weidmann junked the script; he made a "reality movie", composed of footage shot making the film (most without the actors' knowledge).
The footage shows Gwen as self-centered, conniving and manipulative; Eddie is seen as a decent man who becomes paranoid as he begins to suspect that his wife is having an affair.
Gwen and Hector are the antagonists, Eddie is the protagonist and Kiki is his love interest in the story.
The cast and crew--particularly Gwen--are offended by the direction that Weidmann went with instead of sticking to the movie script and demands an explanation.
Eddie is the only cast member pleased with Weidmann's direction and wants to work with him again.
Because of praise from the press, the studio is forced to release the film (Weidmann's plan all along, this include ruining Gwen's career and reviving Eddie's).
Gwen tries to salvage the situation by announcing that she is reconciling with Eddie.
However, he sees past it and openly admits that he's done with her.
Eddie mentions their relationship was a mistake and declares his love for Kiki.
She reciprocates and stands up to Gwen for the first time.
Kiki is fired by Gwen when she reveals dirty secrets about Gwen while they were growing up that even the press, the cast and crew who watched the "reality movie" didn't know about.
After the junket, Gwen selfishly admits to the press that she and Eddie are through and saying she's in love with Hector.
However, their relationship is seen to be disintegrating after Hector overheard Gwen insulting him in the film in addition to the revelation that Hector himself had an affair with Weidmann's young daughter.
Kiki and Eddie prepare to leave the hotel together.
Before they do, Lee catches them kissing and is happy for the two.
Moments after they leave, Lee gets jumped on by Gwen's dog.

Meanwhile, across town, a stray mutt named Tramp lives on his own, dining on scraps from Tony's restaurant and protecting his friends from the local dogcatcher.
One day, Lady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly.
Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby.
While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp interrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of the yard.
As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that "when the baby moves in, the dog moves out".
Eventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, whom Lady grows fond of.
Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with their Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house.
Aunt Sarah's two trouble-making Siamese cats, Si and Am, trick her into thinking that Lady attacked them with the house a mess.
Aunt Sarah takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle.
Lady flees in horror, only to be pursued by a pack of stray dogs.
Tramp rescues her and finds a beaver at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle.
Later, Tramp shows Lady how he lives "footloose and collar-free", eventually leading into a candlelit Italian dinner at Tony's.
Lady begins to fall in love with Tramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby.
Tramp offers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a farmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and brought to the local dog pound.
While at the pound, the other dogs reveal to Lady that Tramp's had multiple girlfriends in the past and they feel it's unlikely he'll ever settle down.
She is eventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away.
Jock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends.
Just as Tramp leaves, Lady sees a rat trying to sneak into the house.
She barks frantically, but Aunt Sarah tells her to be quiet.
Tramp hears her barking and rushes back, entering the house and corners the rat in the nursery.
Lady breaks free and rushes to the nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the baby's crib before ultimately killing the rat.
The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both dogs and assumes that they are responsible.
She pushes Tramp in a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to get rid of Tramp.
Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when they release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat.
Realizing Tramp's true intentions, Jock and Trusty chase after the dog catcher's wagon.
The dogs are able to track down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash.
Jim Dear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy is short-lived when they find Trusty pinned underneath the wagon's wheel, motionless, with Jock howling mournfully.
That Christmas, Tramp's been adopted into the family, and he and Lady have started their own family, with three daughters who look similar to Lady and a son who looks similar to Tramp.
Jock comes to see the family along with Trusty, who's still alive and merely suffered from a broken leg, which is still healing.
Thanks to the puppies, Trusty has a fresh audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them.

Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure

Lady and Tramp have three spunky but well-mannered daughters, Annette, Danielle and Colette, and a feisty and playful but rambunctious and mischievous son, Scamp.
When the family baby, Jim Jr.
tosses a ball Scamp chases after it and makes a mess in the house.
So Jim Dear chains Scamp to a doghouse outside.
Tramp tries to reason with Scamp, but Scamp's wish to be a wild dog causes Tramp to lose his temper.
Later, Scamp sees a pack of stray dogs harassing the dogcatcher outside the yard and becomes intrigued.
He breaks free from his chain and runs off to find them.
He finds a beautiful member of the pack, Angel, and they go to the junkyard with the rest of the Junkyard Dogs.
Meanwhile, Lady sees that Scamp left the doghouse and alerts Tramp and their family.
Scamp confesses that he wishes to join the Junkyard Dogs, but their tough leader, Buster, demands Scamp to pass a few tests.
During the first one, Scamp sneaks up on a large, savage street dog named Reggie, but fails to steal a tin can as Scamp bumps into a trash can loud enough to awaken Reggie.
As Reggie chases Scamp and Angel, they are caught by the dogcatcher.
He nearly catches Angel, but Scamp frees her and lures the dogcatcher to ram the pole of his net into a lightpost.
After the dogcatcher takes Reggie to the dog pound, the rest of all Junkyard Dogs impress Scamp, except Buster.
At the park, one of the Junkyard Dogs tell the story, about Tramp escaping from the group of dogcatchers.
Buster angrily reminds them that Tramp falls in love with Lady to become a house pet.
Scamp is surprised but does not believe that Tramp used to be a Junkyard Dog.
Meanwhile, Lady, Tramp, Jock and Trusty, search for him.
After a romantic stroll, Scamp and Angel happen upon his family searching for him.
When he evades them, Angel is disgusted that he would choose living on the streets over a loving family, as she herself was once a house pet.
At a picnic, the Junkyard Dogs see Scamp's old family.
Realizing that Scamp is Tramp's son, as the second and final test he sets up for Scamp in order to qualify for joining the Junkyard Dogs, Buster orders Scamp to steal a chicken from his family's picnic.
Even though a little bit of conflict ensues over the matter between them and Angel who sees what Buster is really up to, determined to prove that he is a Junkyard Dog, Scamp complies.
After pursuing him to an alley, Tramp asks Scamp to come home, but Scamp refuses and decides to stay with Buster and the dogs.
As Tramp leaves, Buster removes Scamp's collar and declares that Scamp is a Junkyard Dog.
While celebrating, Angel scolds Scamp for not listening to Tramp.
Scamp snaps to Buster and accidentally reveals that Angel wants to be a house pet.
Buster sends Angel out from the pack and she leaves the junkyard.
Wishing to take revenge on Tramp, Buster lures Scamp into getting caught by the dogcatcher.
Realizing that he was selfish and made a terrible mistake, Scamp wishes that he was home with his family.
Angel sees Scamp being sent to the pound and she goes to alert Tramp.
At the pound, Scamp is thrown into the same cage as Reggie.
The massive dog is chained to the wall, but several lunges at Scamp helps him to break free.
Tramp arrives and breaks into the cage just in time.
He uses Reggie's size against him, and locks him back up.
Tramp is about to lead his son out when the dogcatcher arrives.
Recognizing Tramp, he tries to capture them but is bitten in the rear by Angel and in a panic, knocks himself out.
Before heading home, Scamp apologizes to Tramp for running away, while Tramp concedes that he could loosen up a little.
He decides there's nothing wrong with taking his son out to see the river once in a while.
The dogs return to the junkyard, where Scamp retrieves his collar and traps Buster under piles of junk, and the pack members abandon Buster to find owners.
Tramp, Scamp and Angel return home, where the family decides to adopt Angel and Jim gives a bath to Scamp.
As the movie ends, the Junkyard Dogs can be seen with owners of their own.

Grease 2

It is 1961, two years after the original Grease.
The first day of school has arrived and the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies dance and sing as they enter the high school ("Back to School Again").
The Pink Ladies are now led by Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer), who feels she has "outgrown" her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed), the arrogant and rather immature new leader of the T-Birds.
A new arrival comes in the form of clean-cut English student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield) (a cousin of Sandy Olsson from the previous film).
He is welcomed and introduced to the school atmosphere by Frenchy (Didi Conn), who was asked by Sandy to help show Michael around.
Frenchy reveals she has returned to Rydell to get her high school diploma so she can start her own cosmetics company.
Michael eventually meets Stephanie and quickly becomes smitten with her.
At the local bowling alley, a game ("Score Tonight") turns sour due to the animosity between Johnny and Stephanie.
Stephanie retaliates by kissing the next man who walks in the door, who happens to be Michael.
Bemused by this unexpected kiss, Michael asks her out, but he learns that she has a very specific vision of her ideal man ("Cool Rider").
As he realizes that he will only win her affection if he turns himself into a cool rider, Michael accepts payment from the T-Birds to write term papers for them; he uses the cash to buy a motorcycle.
Following an unusual biology lesson ("Reproduction") given by mr Stuart (Tab Hunter), a substitute teacher, a gang of rival motorcyclists called the Cycle Lords (most of whom are members of the defunct Scorpions) led by Leo Balmudo (Dennis Stewart) surprise the T-Birds at the bowling alley.
Before the fight starts, a lone mysterious (unnamed) biker appears (who is Michael in disguise), defeats the enemy gang and disappears into the night ("Who's That Guy.
").
Stephanie is fascinated with the stranger.
Meanwhile, Louis (Peter Frechette), one of the T-Birds, attempts to trick his sweetheart Sharon (Maureen Teefy), one of the Pink Ladies and Stephanie's friends into losing her virginity to him by taking her to a fallout shelter and faking a nuclear attack ("Let's Do It for Our Country").
The next evening while working at a gas station/garage, Stephanie is surprised again by the Cool Rider, and they enjoy a romantic twilight motorcycle ride.
Just as Michael is about to reveal his identity, they are interrupted by the arrival of the T-Birds and Pink Ladies.
Before Michael leaves, he tells Stephanie that he will see her at the school talent show, in which the Pink Ladies and T-Birds are performing.
Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens to fight the Cool Rider if he sees him with her again.
The Pink Ladies walk away haughtily, but this has little effect on the T-Birds' self-confidence ("Prowlin'").
At school, Stephanie's poor grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help.
Johnny, upon seeing them together in a discussion, demands that Stephanie quit the Pink Ladies to preserve his honor ("rep", reputation).
Although still enamored with the Cool Rider, interactions with Michael reveal that she has become romantically interested in him as well.
Michael ponders over his continuing charade he puts on for Stephanie ("Charades").
At the talent show, Stephanie and the Cool Rider meet but are ambushed by the T-Birds who pursue Michael on their respective motorcycles, with Stephanie and the Pink Ladies following in a car.
They chase him to a construction site which conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence suggests that he has perished below, leaving Stephanie heartbroken and inconsolable.
Johnny and his T-Birds remove the competing Preptones preppie boys by tying them to a shower pole in the boys' locker room and drenching them.
During the Pink Ladies' performance in the talent show ("Girl for All Seasons"), Stephanie enters a dreamlike fantasy world where she is reunited with her mystery biker ("(Love Will) Turn Back the Hands of Time").
She is named winner of the contest and crowned the queen of the upcoming graduation luau, with Johnny hailed as king for his performance of "Prowlin'" with his fellow T-Birds.
The school year ends with the luau ("Rock-a-Hula Luau"), during which the Cycle Lords appear and begin to destroy the celebration.
However, the Cool Rider reappears.
After he defeats the Cycle Lords again, he reveals himself to be Michael.
Initially shocked, Johnny gives him a T-Birds jacket, officially welcoming him into the gang, and Stephanie accepts that she can now be with him.
As a reward, Michael and Stephanie kiss for their new love for each other.
All the couples pair off happily at the seniors' graduation as the graduating class sings ("We'll Be Together").
The credits start rolling in yearbook-style, as in the original film.

Nina tells George that her stepsister is constantly trying to fix her up with somebody from higher society, completely ignoring the fact that Nina has a boyfriend, Vince (John Pankow).
During the conversation, Nina offers George a room in her apartment as she has just heard from his boyfriend, dr Robert Joley (Tim Daly), that George is looking for somewhere to live.
George, not knowing about Robert's plans, is taken aback and heartbroken, and after the party the two split up.

[BEGIN STORY]
Gigli

Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a low-ranking Los Angeles mob enforcer who isn't nearly as tough as he likes to act.
Louis (Lenny Venito), a higher-ranking member of Gigli's organization, commands Gigli to kidnap the mentally challenged younger brother of a powerful federal prosecutor to use as a bargaining chip to save New York City-based mob boss Starkman (Al Pacino) from prison.
Gigli successfully convinces the young man, Brian Dorf (Justin Bartha), to go off with him by promising to take him "to the Baywatch", apparently a reference to the television show of that name, which seems to be Brian's singular obsession.
Louis, however, does not trust Gigli to do the job properly, so he hires a woman calling herself Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) to take charge.
Despite being attracted to Ricki, Gigli resents both Louis' lack of faith in him and having to take orders from a woman.
He is also frustrated by Brian's insistence on going to "the Baywatch" and by Ricki's lesbianism.
A suspicious detective (Christopher Walken) comes to the apartment to question Gigli in reference to Brian's disappearance.
Gigli is further annoyed when his mother (Lainie Kazan) takes an immediate liking to Ricki and when the two women team up to needle him.
The events take a darker turn when Gigli and Ricki receive orders to cut off Brian's thumb, something that neither wants to do.
Worse, Ricki's ex-girlfriend, Robin (Missy Crider), shows up at Gigli's apartment, accusing Ricki of changing sexual orientation.
Robin slits her wrists and has to be rushed to the hospital.
While at the hospital, Gigli goes to the morgue and cuts off a corpse's thumb, which he sends to the prosecutor as Brian's thumb.
Gigli and Ricki go back to Gigli's apartment, where Gigli confesses his love and the two sleep together.
The next morning, they are summoned to meet with the mob's boss.
Starkman reveals that he did not approve of the plan to kidnap a federal prosecutor's brother or the order to cut off Brian's thumb.
He nevertheless rages at them because the thumb they sent didn't match Brian's fingerprint and therefore not only failed to increase pressure on the prosecutor but even undermined the organization's credibility.
Starkman then kills Louis, presumably in retaliation for the kidnapping and associated scrutiny by law enforcement.
Starkman is about to kill Ricki and Gigli as well, but Ricki talks him out of it by pointing out that only they know where Brian is and only they can silence Brian and prevent him from revealing the involvement of Starkman's organization in the kidnapping or even accusing Starkman of having been personally involved.
They leave Starkman's home, decide to leave the mob, and discuss taking Brian back to where they found him.
On the way, they discover Baywatch (or a similarly themed show or film) shooting an episode on the beach.
Brian begs to be let off there and finally they consent.
Gigli convinces Ricki to take his car, but at the last minute, Ricki returns and picks up Gigli, and they leave town together.
All of the characters are transformed by the episode: Louis' mob is disrupted, Gigli has dropped his hyper-masculine façade, Ricki has a heterosexual fling with Gigli, and Brian gradually emerges from his shell, noticing other people and conversing.

Two Arabian Knights

During the First World War, two American soldiers become trapped in no man's land.
Expecting to die, Daingerfield Phelps III (William Boyd) decides to fulfill his fondest desire: to beat up his sergeant since training camp, Peter O'Gaffney (Louis Wolheim).
While they are brawling, the Germans sneak up and capture them.
In a German prison camp, the two become friends when Phelps takes responsibility for an unflattering caricature he drew of a guard, rather than let O'Gaffney take the blame.
The two escape, stealing the white robes of Arab prisoners to blend in with the snow.
However, they encounter (and are forced to join) a group of similarly garbed Arab prisoners being sent by train to Constantinople.
Near the end of their journey, Phelps creates a distraction, and the two men jump off, landing in a hay wagon.
When the hay is loaded onto a ship bound for Arabia, so are they.
The stowaways are discovered, but the skipper (Michael Visaroff) is satisfied when Phelps pays him their fare.
When a small boat founders nearby, Phelps jumps in to try to rescue an Arabian woman, Mirza (Mary Astor).
Both he and the woman have to be saved by O'Gaffney.
The two soldiers and the skipper vie for the veiled woman's affections.
Phelps eventually coaxes her into removing her veil, and is entranced by her beauty.
Meanwhile, the woman's escort observes this development with disapproval.
The skipper insists on being paid for Mirza's fare, but none of the three have any money left.
They hold him off as best they can.
When they reach their destination, the skipper refuses to let Mirza debark without paying, so O'Gaffney robs the purser (Boris Karloff) to get the money.
Mirza is met by Shevket Ben Ali (Ian Keith); Mirza informs Phelps that her father has arranged for her to marry Shevket.
They depart.
The Americans jump overboard when the skipper discovers what happened to his purser.
The two men head for the American consul, but leave hastily without speaking to him when they find the skipper already there lodging a complaint.
They decide to seek the assistance of Mirza's father the Emir, who turns out to be the governor of the region.
However, Mirza's escort has told him and Shevket that Phelps has seen her without her veil.
Outraged, the Emir sends his men to bring the Americans back to be executed.
Unaware of this, the two soldiers saunter into the Emir's palace.
Fortunately, Phelps reads Mirza's warning note in time, and the two escape.
When Phelps sets out to rescue Mirza, O'Gaffney shows true friendship and accompanies him.
They are trapped by Shevket and his men, but when Mirza threatens to kill herself, Shevket proposes they settle this with a duel in which only one of the pistols is loaded.
Phelps agrees and fires first; his gun is the unloaded one.
Mirza is made to leave the room.
Then Shevket reveals that both guns are empty; he did not wish to wager his life with a "dog".
He exits, leaving his men to dispose of Phelps.
The two men overcome their captors, relieve Shevket of Mirza, and ride away.

Blue Crush

Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) are best friends.
They raised Anne Marie's 14-year-old sister, Penny (Mika Boorem), ever since their mother took off to Las Vegas with a boyfriend who was uncomfortable with the idea of having the two girls come along.
While Penny is at school, Anne Marie, Eden and Lena work as maids at a large resort hotel, but more importantly, they are surfers.
Anne Marie rises every morning before dawn to train for her surfing comeback, and was once considered a rising star in women's surfing and competed as a youth, but an extreme wipeout and near-drowning incident temporarily halted her career, and left her with deep-seated fears.
Her friends, especially Eden, have encouraged her to try it again.
Anne Marie has been invited to join in an upcoming surf competition at the famed North Shore surf spot, Pipeline.
She hopes to gain the attention of sponsors and get herself and her friends out of the near-poverty they are living in.
As the Pipeline competition gets closer, she struggles to keep Penny under control and deal with her own personal issues.
At work, Anne Marie meets and catches the eye of Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis), a National Football League quarterback in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl (it is hinted that he plays for the Minnesota Vikings).
Matt is there with several of his rowdy teammates and instantly becomes attracted to the surfer.
Through a series of "chance" encounters, she agrees to teach him how to surf for $150 per hour, and brings Lena, Eden and Penny along for the ride.
When she goes to Matt's hotel room to get the money, they kiss as a call comes and Anne suspects that it is his wife but he promises it is his niece.
Later they sleep together.
Her acceptance of a non-local begins to cause friction between her and many of the young men in her surfing social circle.
Anne Marie faces more problems when she and Eden argue about Anne Marie's lack of dedication to training for the Pipeline contest due to the sudden appearance of Matt.
She also has to hear demeaning comments from several of the other football players' wives and girlfriends staying at the hotel about how she is undergoing the "Matt Tollman makeover" while attending a luau at the resort.
Anne Marie confronts Matt about their situation and soon resolves to step up her game, as she finally commits herself to the Pipeline Masters.
On the day of Pipeline, Anne Marie wipes out during her first heat, but advances to the next heat after narrowly beating pro surfer Kate Skarratt.
She is shaken, but Matt tells her a story about his first game as an NFL quarterback and helps her regain her wavering confidence.
Determined, but still afraid, Anne Marie returns to the water.
Competing in the same heat is Keala Kennelly, one of the first professional female surfers, playing herself.
While Keala surfs the first few sets of waves without wipe-outs, Anne Marie still has inhibitions about riding one, visions of another near-drowning incident holding her back.
Keala finishes her turn, then paddles out and takes Anne Marie under her wing and encourages her to take the best wave of the day, on which Anne Marie manages to score perfectly.
Although she does not advance to the next heat, she has regained her lost confidence, but also attracted the notice of sponsors, one of which includes an offer to join the Billabong women's surf team.

No Exit

Three damned souls, Joseph Garcin, Inès Serrano, and Estelle Rigault, are brought to the same room in Hell and locked inside by a mysterious valet.
They had all expected torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead find a plain room furnished in the style of the Second French Empire.
At first, none of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Joseph says that he was executed for being a pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made; Inès, however, is the only one to demand that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their moral crimes.
She refuses to believe that they have all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable; she deduces that they are to be one another's torturers.
Joseph suggests that they try to leave each other alone and to be silent, but Inès starts to sing about an execution and Estelle vainly wants to find a mirror to check on her appearance.
Inès tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her "mirror" by telling her everything she sees, but ends up frightening her instead.
It is soon clear that Inès is attracted to Estelle, Estelle is attracted to Joseph, and Joseph is not attracted to either of the two women.
After arguing, they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other.
Joseph cheated on and mistreated his wife; Inès seduced her cousin's wife while living with them; and Estelle had an affair and then killed the resulting child, prompting the child's father to commit suicide.
Despite their revelations, they continue to get on each other's nerves.
Joseph finally begins giving in to the lascivious Estelle's escalating attempts to seduce him, which drives Inès crazy.
Joseph is constantly interrupted by his own guilt, however, and begs Estelle to tell him he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime.
While she complies, Inès tells him that Estelle is just feigning attraction to him so that she can be with a man – any man.
This causes Joseph to abruptly attempt an escape.
After his trying to open the door repeatedly, it inexplicably and suddenly opens, but he is unable to bring himself to leave, and the others remain as well.
He says that he will not be saved until he can convince Inès to trust in him.
She refuses, saying that he is obviously a coward, and promising to make him miserable forever.
Joseph concludes that rather than torture devices or physical punishment, "hell is other people".
Estelle tries to persevere in her seduction of Joseph, but he says that he cannot make love while Inès is watching.
Estelle, infuriated, picks up a paper knife and repeatedly stabs Inès.
As they are all already dead, this attack does nothing and Inès even halfheartedly stabs herself, beginning to laugh.
As Estelle comments on the idea of their being trapped here forever and laughs too, all three join in a prolonged fit of laughter before Joseph finally concludes, "Eh bien, continuons" (roughly "Eh well, let's continue.
".
).

Johnny is performing at a nightclub, rapping and dancing with his crew and a club background songstress playing "Cool as Ice (Everybody Get Loose)".
While the group passes through a small town, Johnny falls for honor student Kathy Winslow.
The crew is stranded in the town after a member's motorcycle breaks down and has to be left at a local repair shop.
While waiting for repairs, Johnny uses the opportunity to see Kathy.
She already has a boyfriend named Nick, whom he advises Kathy to dump.
Johnny shows up with his crew at a local club frequented by Kathy and her friends.

The gang ambushes the kidnappers and rescue Tommy.
When the police arrive, the gang return Tommy to the Winslows, and Gordon apologizes to Johnny.
The rapper tells Kathy he has to move on, but she decides to follow him.
Nick arrives in his car, telling Kathy to get used to being a biker chick because she will never see him again.
Kathy holds on as Johnny uses the car as a ramp and the two new lovers ride off into the big city.

Return to Mayberry

Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith), now living in Cleveland as a US Postal Inspector, returns to his native Mayberry to see his son Opie (Ron Howard) become a first-time father, and also to run in the soon-to-be held sheriff's election, as he has already asked county clerk Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) to prepare the paperwork.
But when Andy learns that his old deputy Barney Fife (Don Knotts), now back in Mayberry working as acting sheriff, announced his own candidacy while Andy was on the road back to town he quietly tells Opie, "I won't run against Barney".
Andy goes to visit Barney at the sheriff's office.
Barney tells Andy that he decided to run for sheriff because nobody else would, and then his opponent Ben Woods decided to run shortly afterward.
Andy then mentions that Barney's old girlfriend Thelma Lou, newly divorced after less than two years, is back in Mayberry staying with her sister; Barney nonchalantly says he'll eventually go and see her.
As Barney leaves to teach a safety class at school, they're accosted by Ernest Bass standing on the base of the town flagpole, and who gives them a cryptic rhyme: "Your hair was brown but now it's gray; make that monster go away".
The "monster" is revealed to be an elaborate publicity stunt orchestrated by young businessman Wally Butler (Richard Lineback), who bought an oriental restaurant outside of town and added a hotel.
Butler found some old dragon artifacts, presumably left by the restaurant's former owners, and hired Ernest to perpetuate a hoax at Myer's Lake to attract customers by stealing some neighbors' chickens and dogs to make people think they were eaten by the monster.
Andy goes to the cemetery to visit Aunt Bee's grave, and finds Thelma Lou there visiting her uncle's gravesite.
Thelma Lou laments about Barney's not calling, but she follows Andy to the school where Barney, in clown makeup, is playacting for a classroom of students.
Though embarrassed by his appearance, Barney accepts an invitation to dine with Thelma Lou at her sister's house.
Andy ducks out while the two are reacquainting and drives over to the house where Opie and his wife Eunice live just as she is about to go into labor.
In a panic, Opie accidentally crashes his car into a tree, and Andy volunteers his car to take them to the hospital.
On the way, Andy's engine begins to falter, and they only make it as far as Gomer and Goober's garage before Eunice gives birth to a boy.
Shortly afterward, Barney pulls up, already irritated by the fact that no one told him about the birth, which happened all too fast, but his anger is exacerbated when Gomer (Jim Nabors) and Goober (George Lindsey) mistakenly refer to Andy as "sheriff".
Later that night, he visits Andy to apologize for how he acted, saying he also felt "left out" of being part of seeing Opie become a father.
The next day, Gomer and Goober are out fishing at Myer's Lake when Gomer sees a monster sticking its head up out of the water.
Andy and Barney arrive shortly afterward, but Barney doesn't believe Gomer's story until he sees what looks like monster tracks in the mud (made by Ernest wearing specially made galoshes).
When Gomer later shows Barney a picture he took of Goober with something unidentifiable in the background, Barney becomes convinced there's a monster in the lake.
Wally Butler later invites Barney to his new inn, secretly gives him a contribution check for his campaign, and invites him in to talk to a TV news reporter about his discovery.
Andy's wife Helen follows Andy back to Mayberry and only then finds out that Andy has opted out of the sheriff's race, and Opie receives a highly lucrative job offer from a newspaper in Binghamton, New York.
With Barney's opponent Woods now running an aggressive campaign to discredit Barney, Howard and Opie try to convince Andy to re-enter the race, saying that Barney doesn't stand a chance.
Meanwhile, former town drunk Otis Campbell (Hal Smith), now long sober and driving an ice cream truck, is serving customers near Myers Lake when he sees the "monster" pop out of the lake.
Otis quickly races to the courthouse to tell Barney.
Despite Andy's pleading with Barney to drop the hunt because people were laughing at him, Otis' report convinces Barney to resume the hunt.
Later, when Andy and Barney take Helen and Thelma Lou out to dinner at Butler's Inn, Andy notices some old pictures of the restaurant when it was still oriental.
Noticing a particular picture with a dragon's head in it (and remembering Ernest's rhyme), Andy is inspired to do some investigating of his own: He drives up to the hills and visits the Darlings' homestead, where Ernest hangs out.
Briscoe Darling (Denver Pyle) and his daughter Charlene (Maggie Peterson) are delighted to see Andy, but Ernest nervously and repeatedly asks Andy to leave.
After sitting in with the Darlings to play a song, Andy manipulates Ernest into telling him when the monster will show up in Myer's Lake again.
The next day, Helen and Thelma Lou are having lunch at Butler's Inn.
When Helen mentions Andy and Barney are both up at Myer's Lake intent on trapping the "monster", Butler excuses himself and hurriedly drives off to the lake.
At the lake, Barney clumsily baits a trap (involving a frozen chicken tied to the end of a rope) while Andy spots Ernest going into a nearby stone quarry shed.
Butler arrives at the shed to futilely get Ernest to reel the monster back in, but Andy catches both of them in the act.
Barney and Howard follow Andy to the shed, and Andy makes it look like Barney plotted to make Butler overconfident and force his hand.
Howard takes pictures of Barney with the dragon's head for the newspaper, and Andy tells Butler about the legal consequences of his actions, but suggests that Ernest return the stolen chickens and dogs, and then implores Butler to try honesty with his next business venture, saying "It works better".
Later, at a victory rally for Sheriff Fife, when Barney learns that Andy opted out of the sheriff's race to give Barney a better chance to win, he humbly asks the crowd to vote for Andy as a write-in candidate because "That's exactly what I'm gonna do".
Andy is eventually elected the "new" sheriff, Opie accepts the newspaper job in Binghamton, and Barney and Thelma Lou finally get married, with Ernest and the Darlings joining in the celebration.
The final shot (seen behind the end credits) is of Sheriff Taylor and Deputy Fife folding up an American flag at the end of the day on Mayberry's Main Street.

Sweet Charity

The young woman Charity Hope Valentine is a taxi dancer at a dance hall called the Fandango Ballroom in New York City.
With a shoulder bag and a heart tattooed on her left shoulder, Charity meets her boyfriend Charlie in Central Park.
While Charlie silently preens himself, Charity speaks the pick-up lines she imagines him saying, and tells him how handsome he is ("You Should See Yourself").
Charlie then steals her handbag and pushes her into the lake (usually the orchestra pit) before running off.
Passers-by discuss the apparent drowning but do nothing, until a young Spaniard finally rescues her.
In the Hostess Room of the Fandango Ballroom, Charity tries to convince both herself and the other skeptical taxi dancers that Charlie tried to save her.
Nickie, a fellow dancer, tells Charity that her problem is "you run your heart like a hotel — you've always got people checking in and checking out".
The manager, Herman, arrives to tell them it is time for work.
The hostess dancers proposition the audience in the front room of the Fandango Ballroom ("Big Spender").
Helene and Nickie try to comfort Charity about Charlie's absence ("Charity's Soliloquy").
On the street, after work, Charity gives to every beggar who approaches her until she realizes she has no money.
Just then, film star Vittorio Vidal rushes out of the smart Pompeii Club, in pursuit of his beautiful mistress, Ursula.
Ursula refuses to go back inside with Vittorio, who promptly takes the only-too-willing Charity instead.
Inside the Pompeii Club, the dancers are dancing the latest craze, The Rich Man's Frug.
To everyone's astonishment, the famous Vittorio is accompanied by the unknown Charity.
She tries to steer him away from the subject of Ursula.
Finally, he wants to dance.
Not having eaten since breakfast, Charity faints.
There is general agreement amongst the dancers that she needs to be "laid down".
Vittorio asks "where.
", and Charity recovers enough to prompt Vittorio with "your apartment.
".
Lying down on Vittorio's bed, Charity claims she is no longer hungry.
She admits she is a dance hall hostess, putting it down to "the fickle finger of fate" (a favorite expression of hers).
Vittorio is struck by her humor and honesty.
Starstruck, Charity asks for a signed photograph to prove to the girls she was really in his apartment.
While Vittorio fetches props from his old movies for further evidence, Charity remarks on her good fortune ("If My Friends Could See Me Now").
Ursula arrives to apologize for her jealousy; Charity is swiftly bundled into a closet before Vittorio opens the door to Ursula.
("Too Many Tomorrows") While Charity watches from the closet, Vittorio and Ursula make love inside his four-poster bed.
The following morning, Charity is escorted from the room by a mortified Vittorio.
In the Hostess Room, the girls are disappointed that Charity failed to get more out of Vittorio.
Nickie announces she is not going to remain at this job for the rest of her life, prompting the girls to speculate on alternative careers ("There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This"), but Herman brings them back down to earth.
Charity decides to seek some cultural enlightenment from the YMHA on 92nd Street, where she gets stuck in a broken elevator with shy tax accountant Oscar Lindquist.
While trying to calm him down, Charity learns that he is not married.
She declares, "Oh Oscar.
You're gonna be all right".
After helping Oscar overcome his claustrophobia ("I'm the Bravest Individual"), the pair are plunged into new panic when the lights stop working.
After being trapped in a broken elevator, Oscar and Charity are finally rescued when it starts working again.
Oscar invites Charity to go to church with him, to which she hesitantly agrees.
As they walk under the Manhattan Bridge to the church, the faint cries of the next person to be stuck in the elevator are heard.
The Rhythm of Life Church turns out to be a thin veneer on hippie culture ("The Rhythm of Life").
A police raid breaks up the meeting.
Traveling home on the subway, Oscar proposes another date and tries to guess Charity's job, deciding that she works in a bank.
Charity lies, saying she works for First National City, Williamsburg Branch.
As they part, Oscar kisses her hand, and dubs her Sweet Charity ("Sweet Charity").
After two weeks, Oscar and Charity have continued dating, and she still has not confessed what she actually does for a living.
At Coney Island Amusement Park they become trapped again when the Parachute Jump ride breaks.
This time, Oscar is the calm one while Charity is scared — scared that she is starting to depend on him.
Once again, Charity loses her nerve about telling him what her real job is.
As the crowd look on, the couple kiss.
On a slow night at the Fandango, Charity loses the opportunity to snare one of the few customers by a new co-worker, Rosie.
Disgusted by the whole business, she quits.
However, in Times Square, she wonders what the alternative is ("Where Am I Going.
").
Sending a telegram to Oscar, she asks to meet him at Barney's Chile Hacienda.
She admits that she is a dance hall hostess; he admits he already knows, having followed her one night and watched her dancing.
He says he does not care and wants to marry her.
Relieved and elated, Charity leaves ("I'm A Brass Band") and packs a suitcase on which is printed 'Almost Married'.
After a farewell party at the Ballroom ("I Love to Cry at Weddings"), Charity and Oscar walk in the park, whereupon Oscar announces that he cannot go through with the wedding, saying he is unable to stop thinking about the "other men".
Eventually, he pushes her into the lake and runs off.
Emerging from the lake, Charity, speaking directly to the audience, asks "Did you ever have one of those days.
".
Realizing that unlike Charlie, Oscar has not stolen her bag, she shrugs and reprises her opening dance.
The stage blacks out onto three neon signs, reading "And so she lived … hopefully … ever after".

Freaky Friday

A willful, disorganized teenage girl, Annabel Andrews, awakens one Friday morning to find herself in the body of her mother, with whom she had argued the previous night.
Suddenly in charge of taking care of the New York family's affairs and her younger brother Ben (whom Annabel has not-so-affectionately nicknamed "Ape Face" and said "He's so neat, it's revolting.
"), and growing increasingly worried about the disappearance of "Annabel", who appeared to be herself in the morning but has gone missing after leaving the Andrews' home, she enlists the help of her neighbor and childhood friend, Boris, though without telling him about her identity crisis.
As the day wears on and Annabel has a series of increasingly bizarre and frustrating adventures, she becomes gradually more appreciative of how difficult her mother's life is, and learns, to her surprise, that Ben idolizes her, and Boris is actually named Morris, but has a problem with chronic congestion (at least around Annabel) leading him to nasally pronounce ms and ns as bs and ds.
The novel races towards its climax and Ben also disappears, apparently having gone off with a pretty girl whom Boris did not recognize, but Ben appeared to trust without hesitation.
In the climax and dénouement, Annabel becomes overwhelmed by the difficulties of her situation, apparent disappearance of her mother, loss of the children, and the question of how her odd situation came about and when/whether it will be resolved.
Finally, it is revealed that Annabel's mother herself caused them to switch bodies through some unspecified means, and the mysterious girl who took Ben was mrs Andrews in Annabel's body (to which she is restored) made much more attractive by a makeover mrs Andrews gave the body while using it, including the removal of Annabel's braces, an appointment Annabel had forgotten about (and would have missed, had she been the one in her body that day).
The book (and especially the film adaptations and its second sequel, Summer Switch) might be considered a modern retelling of Vice Versa, the 1882 novel by Anstey, in which the protagonists are a father and son.

The Aristocats

In Paris in 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three kittens, Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse, live with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar.
One day while preparing her will with lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares her fortune to be left to her cats until their deaths, and thereafter to Edgar.
Edgar hears this through a speaking tube, and plots to eliminate the cats.
Therefore, he drugs the cats by sleeping pills in their food, and enters the countryside to abandon them.
There, he is ambushed by two hounds, named Napoleon and Lafayette, and the cats are stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse, and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence.
In the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris.
The group briefly hitchhikes in a milk truck before being chased off by the driver.
Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, but Marie falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley, who in turn has to be rescued himself by two English geese, Amelia and Abigail Gabble, who accompany the cats to Paris.
Edgar returns to the country to retrieve his possessions from Napoleon and Lafayette, as the only evidence that could incriminate him.
Travelling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the song Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat.
After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill.
Here, Duchess's loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's proposal of marriage.
Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion, but Edgar places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to Timbuktu; whereupon they direct Roquefort to retrieve O'Malley.
He does so, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, instructing Roquefort to locate Scat Cat and his gang.
This done, the alley cats and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens.
At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself.
Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to exclude Edgar, with Madame remaining ignorant of the reason for Edgar’s departure.
After adopting O’Malley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation housing Paris's stray cats (represented by Scat Cat and his band, who reprise their song).

The Egg and I

MacDonald begins her book with a summary description of her childhood and family.
Her father was an engineer, and moved frequently with his family throughout the West.
Her mother's theory that a wife must support her husband in his career comes into play when the author marries a friend of her brother ("Bob") who soon admits that his dream is to leave his current office job and start a chicken ranch.
Knowing nothing about ranching, but eager to support her husband, the author encourages the dream but is unprepared for the primitive conditions that exist on the ranch he purchases.
From this "set up" the book turns to anecdotal stories that rely upon the proverbial "fish out of water" tales that pit MacDonald against her situation and her surroundings, such as the struggle to keep up with the need for water, which needs to be hand carried from a pond to the house until a tank is installed or keeping a fire going in "Stove" or the constant care that chicks need.
At one point a guest expresses envy of MacDonald and her husband, as she thinks they live a life full of fresh air and beautiful scenery, which is then followed by MacDonald pointing out that while the guest had lounged in bed that morning, she and her husband had been up before sunrise working for several hours, and then again the couple had stayed up long into the night after the guest had gone to bed.

Reality Bites

Four friends who recently graduated from college live together in Houston, Texas.
Coffee-house guitarist Troy Dyer and budding filmmaker Lelaina Pierce are attracted to each other, although they have not acted on their feelings except for one brief, drunken encounter.
Troy is floundering, having lost several minimum wage jobs—the last of which he loses early in the film for stealing a candy bar from his employer.
Lelaina was valedictorian of her university, and has aspirations to become a documentarian, although initially having to settle for a position as production assistant to a rude and obnoxious TV host.
Lelaina meets Michael Grates when she throws a cigarette into his convertible, causing him to crash into her car.
The two soon begin to date.
He works at an MTV-like cable channel called "In Your Face" as an executive, and after learning about a documentary she's been working on, wants to get it aired on his network.
Lelaina's roommate Vickie has a series of one-night stands and short relationships with dozens of guys; her promiscuity leads her to confront a very-real risk of contracting HIV after a former fling tests positive for the virus.
Vickie works as a sales associate for The Gap, and is later promoted to manager and seems content with her new job.
Her friend Sammy Gray is gay; he remains celibate, not because of a fear of AIDS, but because forming a relationship would force him to come out to his conservative parents.
After an impulsive act of retribution, Lelaina loses her job, which causes some tension with her roommates.
Eventually, Vickie's AIDS test comes back negative and Sammy comes out to his parents (and he even starts dating) and the two manage to resume their lives.
Meanwhile, Lelaina's relationship with Michael dissolves after he helps her sell the documentary to his network, only to let them edit it into a stylized montage that she feels compromises her artistic vision.
Lelaina and Troy then sleep together and confess their love.
The morning after, he avoids her, and after a messy confrontation, leaves town.
After Troy's father dies, he forces himself to reevaluate his life, deciding to attempt a relationship with Lelaina.
Troy and Lelaina reunite and make amends after Troy returns from his father's funeral in Chicago.
While we do not see what happens to Michael, during the credits there is an abrupt break where two characters, "Laina" and "Roy", who are obvious parodies of Lelaina and Troy, have an argument about their relationship.
As the "show's" credits roll, Michael's name is revealed as the producer, implying that he has turned the failed relationship into the subject of a new show on his network.

The film is told mostly in flashback, with Eli recounting his side to Esther (Doris Roberts), an HIV clinic worker as he waits for test results and Tom to a guy he meets at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
Tom is the son of emotionally distant alcoholic WASP parents who never quite accepted his sexual orientation and as a result is a heavy drinker himself and has a penchant for random hookups with different men.

On the date, a boring evening is broken up only by an amusing diatribe by Tom against the movie In & Out.
A few days later they run into each other at a flea market and hit it off, winding up back at Eli's place where Tom spends the night.
The next morning Tom says that it was a mistake.
Jackie and Brett decide to try again to set them up, and the two men start to develop a relationship.
Tom's fear of becoming emotionally close coupled with Eli's own insecurities makes it difficult for them to maintain, but Jackie and Brett get engaged which forces Tom and Eli together.
They disguise their unease behind petty arguments over meaningless details of grammar and pronunciation but are finally able to push past the pettiness and make love.
Eli tells Tom he loves him and Tom, terrified, lashes out at him the next day and drives him away.
The flashbacks end here on the day of Brett and Jackie's wedding.
Esther tries to teach Eli to be more understanding of Tom's emotional needs.
The AA member tries to sexually assault Tom, and when he tells Jackie she upbraids him for throwing Eli away for daring to fall for him.
At the reception, Eli and Tom come to realize that they have to overcome their families' dysfunction and their own fears.

Muriel's Wedding

A socially awkward, fat, naïve "ugly duckling", who is obsessed with the music of ABBA, Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette) is the target of ridicule by the more fashion-conscious girls she considers her friends.
She also is a perpetual daydreamer who yearns for a glamorous wedding and marriage to a man who will help get her out of the fictional dead-end seaside tourist town of Porpoise Spit, Queensland, improve her personal life, and free her from a tedious life dominated by her demanding and often psychologically abusive father Bill (Bill Hunter), a corrupt politician who verbally lashes out at his weak and subservient wife Betty and their unambitious children at every opportunity.
Her former friends Tania, Nicole and Janine shun Muriel because they see her as a directionless no-hoper, as well as due to embarrassment over her past awkward antics.
They proceed to continue planning a holiday to Hibiscus Island, without her.
While at dinner with some property developers, Heslop runs into her father's mistress, Deidre Chambers, who has done well in a cosmetics pyramid marketing scheme and she recruits Muriel.
The following day Muriel's mother writes a blank check to cash intending for the money to let Muriel buy into the scheme.
Instead, Muriel uses the blank check to defraud her parents, draining their bank account of $12,000, which she uses to go follow her former friends to Hibiscus Island.
While on the Island, Muriel's former friends confront her over her stalking, requesting that she leave them alone.
Later in the evening, Muriel runs into Rhonda Epinstock (Rachel Griffiths), a fellow social outcast from her high school days who is also more outgoing.
Rhonda confronts Muriel's former social-group who also bullied her in high-school.
As Rhonda and Muriel catch up, Muriel invents a grandiose fantasy of a fiancé.
At the end of her holiday, Muriel returns home only to be confronted by her mother over the fraud.
Muriel immediately leaves the house and moves to Sydney where she shares a flat with Rhonda and changes her name to 'Mariel'.
Several months later on a typical night, Rhonda and Mariel go to a nightclub.
Rhonda meets two American sailors while Muriel takes a nice man, Brice Nobes, she met at her minimum wage job in a local video store.
Later, while engaged in foreplay, Muriel and her companion break a window.
The sailors that were in Rhonda's bedroom go out to investigate and assume that Muriel's companion is attempting to rape her.
It is during this episode that Rhonda falls down, apparently paralyzed.
While waiting overnight in the emergency room in Sydney, Muriel calls her family home where she learns that the Australian Federal Police are investigating her father for corruption.
Rhonda discovers she has a malignant tumour pressing on her spine and requires urgent surgery.
Muriel then co-opts Rhonda's health crisis as the basis of a deception to obtain a free photo shoot from a bridal shop.
During one of Rhonda's rehab sessions, Muriel promises that she will take care of Rhonda and that they will never need to return to their hometown.
Rhonda discovers that Muriel has tried on every wedding dress in Sydney and confronts her, forcing Muriel to confess the depth of her deception.
Rhonda's cancer returns, necessitating more severe surgery and leaving her permanently paralyzed.
Desperate to get married, Muriel enters into a conspiracy to commit visa fraud marrying South African swimmer David Van Arkle so that he can stay in Australia and compete in the upcoming Olympics.
Muriel agrees to marry David for $10,000 hoping to pay her father off.
At Muriel's elaborate wedding, her former friend group serve as the bridesmaids, while Rhonda bound to her wheelchair is relegated to being a guest.
Muriel had asked Rhonda to be a bridesmaid but Rhonda turned her down.
Muriel's father is accompanied by his mistress and Muriel's mother arrives late to the wedding, missing the actual ceremony.
Muriel doesn't notice her mother at the back of the church and just walks past.
Rhonda moves back to Porpoise Spit with her mother as she can no longer live in Sydney without any help, as Muriel moves in with her new husband.
After the ceremony, Muriel and David return to David's apartment and he gives her a perfunctory tour of place.
After showing Muriel to her bedroom, David makes his contempt for Muriel known asking "what kind of person marries someone they don't know.
" to which she replies "you did".
His face shows contempt when she says that she too wants to win.
Realizing that their relationship will always be platonic, Muriel sits on her bed and contemplates the view.
Meanwhile, back in Porpoise Spit, Muriel's distraught mother accidentally shop-lifts a pair of sandals from a supermarket.
Bill arranges with the police for the charges to disappear and takes Muriel's mother home where he announces his intention to divorce Betty and marry his mistress, Deidre Chambers.
Betty sets the backyard on fire, then commits suicide by taking sleeping pills.
Realising that Betty lived only for her family and that her constant marginalization and being married to a man that didn't really love her broke Betty's will to live, Muriel breaks down and realizes that all the frauds, falsehoods and lies only lead to pain.
David comforts Muriel and they finally consummate their marriage.
Muriel realizes that she can move beyond her family-of-origin issues, that her actions have consequences and that her choices matter.
The next morning Muriel asks David, who has decided that he likes having her around, for a divorce.
However, she leaves him at the hotel wishing him good luck in the games.
Bill asks Muriel to stay and help raise the kids; she refuses and returns to Sydney.
She repays $5,000 of the $12,000 she stole, saying that she will repay the rest when she gets a job back in Sydney.
She also states that she will no longer put up with his rude and emotionally abusive treatment of her and her siblings.
Although a little taken aback by her new more assertive personality at first, he nonetheless respects her decision and gives her his blessing to move back to Sydney.
Muriel visits Rhonda at her mother's house and offers to take her back Sydney.
Rhonda accepts who in turn tells off Muriel's former friends.
When one of them tries to make an insulting comeback Muriel and Rhonda just laugh it off as Muriel with her more confident attitude no longer cares about what they think of her.
They take a taxi cab to the airport and along the way they say goodbye to various Porpoise Spit "attractions" (such as the shopping mall, the beach, the tourists, and the condos) and ride off to a more promising future.

Shallow Hal

Hal Larson (Jack Black) is a superficial man whose fixation on the physical beauty of women gets in the way of seeing their inner beauty.
Hal and his equally shallow friend, Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander), spend their nights obnoxiously hitting on beautiful women at nightclubs.
Hal's work life is steady, but he is dismayed after being passed over for a long-sought promotion.
Hal becomes trapped in an elevator with famous American life coach Tony Robbins.
While waiting for the elevator to be repaired, Robbins sympathizes with Hal's disappointment but tries to figure out his ideas about women.
He hypnotizes Hal into only seeing a person's inner beauty.
Hal does not realize he's been hypnotized and later meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), daughter of the president of the company where he is employed.
Rosemary is morbidly obese, but Hal sees a slender and beautiful trophy blonde.
He is immediately smitten by her.
His boss is not certain about Hal dating his daughter, thinking that Hal may be trying to climb to the top of the corporate ladder.
Used to being overlooked due to her appearance, Rosemary initially interprets Hal’s interest as mocking, but begins to realize his feelings for her are sincere.
After apologizing to him, they begin to date, which includes a bike ride with Walt (Rene Kirby).
Mauricio, worried about Hal's new taste in women, convinces Robbins to give him the trigger phrase to undo the hypnosis.
Mauricio phones Hal, who is on a date with Rosemary, and says the trigger phrase, which serves to break Hal's hypnosis.
Mauricio confesses to Hal the truth about Robbins' hypnotherapy, but Hal does not believe until he runs into a woman who initially appeared beautiful to him but whom Hal now sees in her true, unattractive state.
Hal begins to avoid Rosemary, who becomes melancholic without him around.
Distraught that he was not seeing the "real" Rosemary, Hal accepts a dinner invitation from his neighbor, Jill.
The two dine together and Jill tells Hal that she has observed him overcoming his shallow nature and is interested in dating him now.
Hal realizes his true feelings for Rosemary who has, coincidentally, arrived at the same restaurant with her family and sees Hal and Jill seated together.
Assuming the worst, Rosemary leaves in tears.
Not recognizing Rosemary, Hal walks right by her on his way to the pay phone to, ironically, reassure her of his feelings, after refusing to date Jill because of his feelings for Rosemary.
Confused and distraught, Rosemary calls Hal a "psycho" over the phone and effectively breaks up with him.
Five days later Steve informs Hal that Rosemary’s Peace Corps partner, Ralph, wants to be in a relationship with her again.
Hal attempts to find Rosemary, but instead encounters a young patient named Cadence at the hospital where Rosemary volunteers.
Previously, due to Robbins’ hypnosis, Hal saw Cadence as a perfect little girl; he now sees that there are severe burns all over Cadence’s face.
Inspired by Cadence, Hal changes his views on the outer appearances of people in general.
Rosemary decides to leave the country to rejoin the Peace Corps.
Hal, during his search for Rosemary, finds that Mauricio had his own reason for stopping Hal's hypnosis: He has a vestigial tail, which has prevented him from ever getting close to a woman.
Mauricio confesses he was jealous of Hal's happiness and is afraid to start a relationship with a woman.
Hal convinces Mauricio to accept his abnormality, with confidence.
Hal makes up with Mauricio and decides to reconcile with Rosemary.
He heads to the Peace Corps and confronts Ralph, believing he and Rosemary got back together.
Ralph informs Hal that Rosemary's mother forbade him from seeing her again.
Hal arrives at the home of Rosemary's parents, where a bon voyage party for Rosemary is underway.
Rosemary initially rebuffs Hal's presence, but then accepts his apology when Hal professes his love for her.
Rosemary informs Hal she is still leaving on her Peace Corps mission.
Hal says he is coming, too, having just been sworn into the Peace Corps right before arriving to the Shanahan's home.
Hal and Rosemary reconcile, cheered by the crowd as they kiss.
He tries to carry her bridal-style to the car, but finds he can’t lift her, so she carries him instead.
As they drive off, Mauricio meets a woman who loves dogs and the two walk off together as he wags his "tail".

Love Actually

The film begins with a voiceover from David (Hugh Grant) commenting that whenever he gets gloomy about the state of the world he thinks about the arrivals terminal at Heathrow Airport, and the pure uncomplicated love felt as friends and families welcome their arriving loved ones.
David's voiceover also relates that all the messages left by the people who died on the 9/11 planes were messages of love and not hate.
The film then tells the 'love stories' of many people: With the help of his longtime manager Joe (Gregor Fisher), rock and roll legend Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) records a Christmas variation of The Troggs' classic hit "Love Is All Around".
Although he thinks the record is terrible, Mack promotes the release in the hope it will become the Christmas number one single.
The song does reach number one; after briefly celebrating his victory at a party hosted by Sir Elton John, Billy discerns that Joe is in need of affection and suggests that he and Joe celebrate Christmas by getting drunk and watching porn.
Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) get married in a lovely ceremony orchestrated and videotaped by Mark (Andrew Lincoln), the best man.
Both Juliet and Peter believe that Mark dislikes her; he is in fact in love with her, and behaves coldly to her to avoid revealing how he really feels.
One day, Juliet comes to see Mark and says she wants them to be friends.
He then shows her the wedding video, which is full of adoring closeups of her.
After an uncomfortable silence, Mark blurts out that he snubs her out of "self-preservation".
On Christmas Eve, the doorbell rings at Juliet and Peter's house.
She runs down and opens the door, only to find Mark, carrying a boom box playing Christmas songs and large cue cards on which he has written that he loves her, but is willing to step aside so she can be happy.
As he walks away, Juliet runs after him to give him a quick, innocent kiss and runs back inside.
Writer Jamie (Colin Firth) is pushed to Juliet and Peter's wedding by his girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) as she feigns illness.
He returns between the ceremony and the reception to check on her, and discovers that she is having an affair with his brother.
Crushed, Jamie withdraws to his French cottage where he meets Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz), who does not speak English.
Despite their inability to communicate, they become attracted to each other.
When Jamie returns to England, he realises he is in love with Aurélia and begins learning Portuguese.
He returns to France to find her and ends up walking through town, gathering people as they walk to her job at a restaurant.
In his broken Portuguese he declares his love for her and proposes.
She says yes in broken English as the crowd erupts in applause.

10 Things I Hate About You

Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes instantly smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford.
Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date.
Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home.
Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate.
Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.
When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat.
Cameron selects "bad boy" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off.
Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca.
Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances.
Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes.
Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest.
She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.
At the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk.
Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a band.
However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated.
Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected.
Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home.
Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him.
Bianca responds by kissing him.
Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the prom so he can take Bianca.
Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money.

They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against.
Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too.
Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him.
Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it.
Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.
All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night.
Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken.
Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron.
Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.
The next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron.
Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College.

Bewitched

A beautiful witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) meets and marries a mortal named Darrin Stephens (originally Dick York, later Dick Sargent).
While Samantha complies with Darrin's wishes to become a normal suburban housewife, her magical family disapproves of the mixed marriage and frequently interferes in the couple's lives.
Episodes often begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, the effects of which wreak havoc with mortals such as his boss, clients, parents, and neighbors.
By the epilogue, however, Darrin and Samantha most often embrace, having overcome the devious elements that failed to separate them.
The witches and their male counterparts, warlocks, are very long-lived; while Samantha appears to be a young woman, many episodes suggest she is actually hundreds of years old.
To keep their society secret, witches avoid showing their powers in front of mortals other than Darrin.
Nevertheless, the effects of their spells – and Samantha's attempts to hide their supernatural origin from mortals – drive the plot of most episodes.
Witches and warlocks usually use physical gestures along with their incantations.
To perform magic, Samantha often twitches her nose to create a spell.
Special visual effects are accompanied by music to highlight such an action.
The main setting for most episodes is the Stephens' house at 1164 Morning Glory Circle, in an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood, either in Westport, Connecticut or Patterson, New York as indicated by conflicting information presented throughout the series.
The season 3 episode "Soap Box Derby" shows the Mills Garage in Patterson as a neighbor's son's car sponsor, and the Stephens' station wagon is seen with New York plates.
Elizabeth Montgomery owned a second home in Patterson.
Many scenes also take place at the fictional Madison Avenue advertising agency "McMann and Tate", where Darrin works.
During its run, the series had a number of major cast changes, often because of illness or death of the actors.
In particular, the performer playing Darrin was replaced mid-season.

My Big Fat Greek Wedding

30-year-old Fotoula "Toula" Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) feels that she is the only woman in her family who has "failed" at being a typical Greek girl.
Her family expects her to be more like her 33-year-old sister Athena (Stavroula Logothettis) and marry a Greek boy, make Greek babies, and "feed everyone until the day she dies".
Instead, Toula is stuck working in the family restaurant in Chicago, "Dancing Zorba's".
Frumpy and cynical, she fears that she is doomed to be stuck with her life.
One day while at the restaurant, Toula briefly becomes enamored with and embarrasses herself in front of Ian Miller (John Corbett), a handsome school teacher.

On the night of the date, Andie waits for Blane at TRAX, but he is late.
Duckie comes in and asks Andie to go out with him, but she ignores him.
Iona gives her a pep talk, while Duckie, still oblivious, asks what's wrong.

In 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is an engaging and entertaining wedding singer from Ridgefield, New Jersey.
He is engaged to his long-time girlfriend, Linda (Angela Featherstone), who was attracted to him at a time when he dreamed of becoming a rock star.
He meets and befriends a waitress, Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore), at the reception hall where he regularly performs.
She is also engaged to businessman Glenn Gulia (Matthew Glave) and he promises to sing at their wedding.
On their wedding day, Robbie's sister, Kate, informs him about Linda changing her mind, leaving him emotionally devastated and humiliated.
Later that day, she visits him and he confronts her for leaving him at the altar, rather than tell him the truth so they can cancel the wedding.
She reveals that she stopped loving him when she found out that he lost his ambitions of being a rock star and instead became a wedding singer.
She tells him that after talking to her friends, she realizes she can't continue lying to herself and ends their relationship.
He tries to move forward with his life, but despair hinders his performances.
Julia tries to cheer him up and later asks him to help her plan her own wedding.
He eventually agrees and their friendship blossoms.
Meanwhile, as he spends more time with her, she begins to realize how shallow Linda is.
During a double date between Julia and Glenn, and Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor), Robbie learns that Glenn frequently cheats on Julia and does not plan to stop after they get married.
Julia and Robbie are increasingly confused by their deepening feelings for each other.
He tells her he has plans to retire from singing and pursue a more conventional career, thinking that will impress her.
She becomes angry with him for assuming that she is marrying Glenn for his money (although she is under pressure from her worried parents to do just that so she will not tread water as they have).
Dismayed, he goes to a bar where his friend, Sammy (Allen Covert), says that guys who refuse to settle down get forgotten, using the example of once-popular TV shows featuring single swinging guys that got cancelled due to the same old schtick, which inspires him to proceed to the Sullivan house to tell Julia how he feels.
When he arrives, he sees her through her bedroom window.
She is wearing her wedding dress, to which he mistakenly concludes that she is looking forward to marrying Glenn.
In actuality, she is expressing doubts about him, particularly her new name of Julia Gulia and imagines herself as Robbie's bride would be nice, hence her imagined glee.
Heartbroken, Robbie leaves to get drunk and finds Glenn in the midst of his pre-bachelor party.
After a heated exchange, he punches Robbie and proceeds to mock him.
An intoxicated Robbie goes home and finds Linda waiting for him and wanting to reconcile.
He passes out, but the following morning, she answers the door and introduces herself as his fiancée to a crestfallen Julia.
She runs to Glenn, wanting to be married immediately.
He happily offers to take her to Las Vegas.
Before getting on the plane and during the flight, she begins to show regret for planning to marry him.
Robbie awakens and after shaking off his hangover from the previous night, tells Linda that it's over and kicks her out.
Then he attends the 50th wedding anniversary party of his friend, Rosie (to whom he has been giving singing lessons).
Inspired by this and with her encouragement, he decides to pursue Julia.
Just then, Holly arrives and asks him if he is still with Linda.
He reveals he ended it with her and learns of Julia's plans to marry Glenn.
He, Sammy, and Holly rush to the airport, where he books a flight to Las Vegas.
He gets a first class ticket because all coach seats are sold out.
After telling his story to an empathetic audience in first class, which includes Billy Idol (playing himself, sporting his 1980s trademark spiked hairdo and biker attire), he learns that Glenn and Julia are on the same flight as he looks through the curtain separating first class and coach.
Over the loudspeaker and with the help of Billy and the flight crew, he sings a song he has written called "Grow Old With You," which he has dedicated to Julia.
When he enters the coach section, Glenn tries to attack him, only for his path to be blocked by a male flight attendant and Billy both pushing refreshment carts.
When Glenn threatens Billy, a burly fan of his also wearing biker attire forces Glenn down the aisle and a female flight attendant he tried seducing earlier pushes him into the lavatory.
Robbie and Julia admit their love for each other and after Billy briefly interrupts them to offer Robbie support in fulfilling his dream of being a songwriter, they share a kiss.
The film ends as the scene fades to a similar kiss, this time at their wedding.
Dave Veltri (Steve Buscemi), the groom's best man from an earlier wedding, becomes the new wedding singer.

The Santa Clause 2

Eight years have elapsed since Scott Calvin took on the mantle of Santa Claus and became subject to The Santa Clause.
Now he is at the top of his game at the North Pole and could not be happier, at least until Head Elf Bernard and Curtis, the Keeper of the Handbook of Christmas break the news that there is another clause — the "Mrs.
Clause".
Santa/Scott is now pressed to get married before the next Christmas Eve, or the clause will be broken and Christmas will fade away.
At the same time, Abby the Elf delivers news that is more distressing: Santa's own son Charlie is on the naughty list, for acts including vandalizing the walls of the school gymnasium with spray paint, until he is caught by Principal Carol Newman.
Scott must return to his home to search for a wife and set things right with Charlie.
He brings this up when visited by the Council of Legendary Figures consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, Cupid, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman.
To cover for Santa's prolonged absence, Curtis helps Santa create a life-size toy replica of Santa, much to Bernard's horror.
However, this replacement cannot find any grace or slack in his plastic heart for minor infractions by children the world over, having followed the Handbook too strictly.
Toy Santa takes control of the North Pole with an army of life-size toy soldiers.
He thinks that everyone is naughty, and he plans to give the entire world lumps of coal.
Because of the impending end of his contract, Scott undergoes a "de-Santafication process" that gradually turns him back into Scott Calvin.
He has a limited amount of magic to help him.
Scott attempts to reconcile with Charlie, who keeps vandalizing his school to get attention.
He and Charlie both face the ire of Principal Newman when Charlie defaces the lockers.
Charlie confesses to Scott how hard it is for him that Scott is never around like other fathers, and reveals the stress he is under to conceal the secret that his father is Santa.
Scott vows to try harder as a dad, and he and Charlie reconcile.
After a few failed dates, Scott finds himself falling for Carol, the school principal.
He accompanies her in a sleigh to the faculty Christmas party, which turns out to be dull.
Using a little of his Christmas magic, Scott enlivens the party by presenting everyone with their childhood dream gifts.
He makes a special presentation to Carol, and, with his last remnant of magic, wins her over and they kiss passionately.
However, she balks when he attempts to explain he is Santa, believing that Scott is mocking her childhood, until Charlie manages to convince her by showing her his magic snow globe.
Curtis flies in to deliver the news about the Toy Santa's coal binge.
However, Scott has used up the last of his magic wooing Carol, and Comet has eaten too many chocolate bars.
With a little help from the Tooth Fairy, Scott and Curtis return to the North Pole.
Toy Santa wastes no time in subduing Scott, but Charlie and a now-believing Carol spring him free by summoning the Tooth Fairy to fly them there.
Scott goes after the Toy Santa, who has already left with the sleigh, riding Chet, a reindeer-in-training, and they both crash back into the village.
With an army of elves, Carol, Bernard, Charlie and Curtis lead a snowball war to overthrow the toy soldiers.
Toy Santa is reduced to his normal six-inch height, Scott marries Carol in a ceremony presided over by Mother Nature herself, Scott transforms back to Santa, and Christmas proceeds as it always has.
Scott and Carol have a three month honeymoon to go on the next day.
In addition, Scott and Charlie reveal the truth to Lucy, Charlie's younger half-sister (the daughter of Laura and Neil) about Scott being Santa Claus.

A Cinderella Story

Samantha "Sam" Montgomery lives in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles, with her widowed father Hal, who runs a popular sports-themed diner.
Hal soon marries an exceedingly vain, and selfish woman named Fiona, who has socially-awkward fraternal twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella.
During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Hal is killed when he runs to save Fiona.
Having supposedly left no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house, the diner, and to her dismay, Sam.
Eight years later, Sam is employed as a waitress at the diner to save money to attend Princeton University, but she is regularly tormented by her stepfamily: constant insulting and treat her like if they were popular, despite them being regarded as weirdos.
Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where queen bee, cheerleader Shelby Cummings, also torments her and calls her "Diner Girl" along with other members of the popular clique.
Sam confides in her online pen pal "Nomad" about her dream to attend Princeton, a dream which he also shares.
However, Nomad's true identity is Austin Ames, the popular, yet unhappy, quarterback of the school's football team, and Shelby's ex-boyfriend, although she refuses to accept that he has broken up with her.
The reason why he is unhappy is because Austin's father planned for him to go to the University of Southern California with a football scholarship, other than going to Princeton.
Nomad proposes that they meet in person at the school's Halloween themed homecoming dance.
On the night of the dance, Fiona orders Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance.
Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her best friend, Carter Ferrell, to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend.
Rhonda, Sam's other best friend, and the rest of the diner's staff also convince her to disobey Fiona and go to the dance anyway.
Sam, wearing a mask and a beautiful white dress, meets "Nomad" at the dance, and is surprised to learn that he is Austin, who had become smitten with her upon her entrance.
The two decide to leave the party to walk alone and get to know each other a little better.
While sharing a romantic dance, Sam and Austin begin to fall in love.
But just as Austin is about to unmask her, Sam's cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona returns at midnight.
She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on the way out.
Austin picks up her phone and begins a desperate search to figure out who his "Cinderella" really is, but every girl at school claims to be the mysterious owner of the phone.
Sam is reluctant to reveal her identity to Austin, feeling that he will not accept her due to her being ordinary and Austin being popular.
When Austin comes into the diner one day, Sam is forced to help him and, after a talk, she attempts to reveal her identity to him, but is cut off by Fiona.
Sam's stepsisters discover Sam and Austin's email relationship, and (after having failed to convince Austin that one of them is the owner of the phone) convince Shelby that Sam tried to steal Austin from her.
During a pep rally, they and the other cheerleaders humiliate Sam in front of the entire school and expose her identity as well as naming her an impostor.
Austin, hurt by Sam's secrecy, does not step up to defend her, and Sam leaves the pep rally feeling devastated.
Like Austin, Sam had been accepted to Princeton, only to be duped by Fiona into believing she was rejected, by having a fake rejection letter made.
Sam then decides to give up her dreams and resigns herself to working at the diner, but Rhonda gives Sam a pep talk not to lose hope.
When her stepsisters come in, they slam the door, causing a guitar to fall off the wall, tearing the wallpaper down with it and blame it on Sam.
Sam then sees her father's words, "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game," and regains her confidence (in real life this quote came from Babe Ruth).
She stands up to Fiona, quits her job at the diner, and moves in with Rhonda, who also quits along with the entire diner staff, all of whom had only put up with so many years of Fiona's abuse after Hal's death for Sam's sake.
The customers, who witness the entire scene, promptly leave in disgust as well.
Before the school's homecoming football game, Sam confronts Austin about his cowardice and not defending her at the pep rally.
Before the final play of the game, he sees Sam making her way out of the stands, and finally stands up to his father, saying he wants to attend Princeton rather than simply play football all his life.
He chases after Sam and apologizes.
She accepts his apology and they share their first kiss as rain falls over the drought-plagued valley.
Soon after, Sam finds Hal's will hidden in her childhood fairy-tale book, stating that all of his money & possessions actually belong to her.
Since this leaves her as their rightful and legal owner, Sam sells her stepfamily's fancy cars so that she can pay for college, and Fiona, who signed the will as a witness but claims to have never seen it before, is arrested by the police.
Fiona, Brianna, and Gabriella are made by the District Attorney to work off the money they stole from Sam at the diner, which is restored to its former glory by its new owners, Sam and Rhonda.
Sam finds that she was in fact accepted by Princeton; the acceptance letter is retrieved from the garbage by her stepsisters, who knew where Fiona hid it.
Also, Austin's father comes to accept his son's desire to attend Princeton.
Things even work out in the end for Carter as he makes a commercial for acne medication.
Shelby, having previously turned Carter down after he defended her at the Halloween dance, aims to pursue him since he is now popular, but after finally seeing her true colors, he turns her down for Astrid, the high school's goth DJ and announcer.
The film ends with Sam and Austin, now officially a couple, driving off to Princeton together.

Funny Face

Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) is a fashion magazine publisher and editor, for Quality magazine, who is looking for the next big fashion trend.
She wants a new look for the magazine.
Maggie wants the look to be both "beautiful" and "intellectual".
She and famous fashion photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) want models who can "think as well as they look".
The two brainstorm and come up with the idea to find a "sinister-looking" book store in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan.
They subsequently find a bookstore named "Embryo Concepts".
Maggie and Dick take over Embryo Concepts, which is being run by the shy bookshop clerk and amateur philosopher, Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn).
Jo thinks the fashion and modeling industry is nonsense, saying: "it is chichi, and an unrealistic approach to self-impressions as well as economics".
Maggie decides to use Jo in the first fashion shot, to give it a more intellectual look.
After the first shot Maggie locks Jo out of the shop to keep her from interrupting the rest of the photo shoot.
What Jo wants more than anything else in the world is to go to Paris and attend the famous philosopher/professor Emile Flostre's (Michel Auclair) lectures about empathicalism.
When Dick gets back to the darkroom, he sees something in Jo's face which is "new" and "fresh", and which would be perfect for the campaign, giving it "character", "spirit", and "intelligence".
They send for Jo, pretending they want to order some books from her shop.
Once she arrives, they start treating her like a doll, trying to make her over, pulling at her clothes and attempting to cut her hair.
She is outraged and runs away, only to hide in the darkroom where Dick is working.
When Dick mentions Paris, Jo becomes very interested in that she would get a chance to see Professor Flostre, and is finally convinced to model for the magazine.
Soon, Maggie, Dick, and Jo are off to Paris to prepare for a major fashion event, shooting photos at famous landmarks from the area.
During the various photo shoots, Jo and Dick develop feelings for each other and they fall in love.
One night, when Jo is getting ready for a gala, she learns that Flostre is giving a lecture at a cafe nearby.
She attends, forgetting the gala.
Eventually, Dick finds her and they get into an argument at the gala's opening, which results in Jo being publicly embarrassed and Maggie outraged.
Jo goes to talk to Flostre at his home.
Through some scheming, Maggie and Dick make it into the soiree at Flostre's home.
After performing an impromptu song and dance for Flostre's disciples, they confront Jo and Flostre.
This eventually leads to Dick causing Flostre to fall and knock himself out.
Jo urges them to leave.
When Flostre wakes up, he tries to make a pass at Jo.
Shocked at the behavior of her "idol", she smashes a vase over his head and runs out.
Before the group leaves for home, there is a final fashion show.
Jo and Maggie try to get in touch with Dick, who has made plans to leave Paris.
Jo does the runway show and before her wedding gown finale, she looks out the window and sees the plane Dick was supposed to be on, take off.
Heartbroken, she runs off the runway in tears at the conclusion of the show.
Meanwhile, Dick is at the airport.
He runs into Flostre and learns that Jo bashed him on the head with a vase.
Dick, realizing how much he cares, goes back to find Jo.
He goes back to the runway show, only to find that Jo is nowhere to be found.
Finally, after a long search, Dick finds Jo (in the wedding gown) by a little church where they shared a romantic moment during an earlier photo shoot.
They embrace and kiss.

Isabel discovers that he has a married Russian lover, Magda Tellman, whom he intends to marry after securing a divorce from Roxy.
Roxy refuses to divorce him.
Paris-based American author Olivia Pace (Glenn Close), a friend of Roxy's, offers Isabel a job.
The sisters visit the Claide-Henri's family's country home for Sunday brunch, where Isabel meets Claude-Henri's mother (Leslie Caron), and her handsome middle-aged brother-in-law, Edgar.
Isabel also meets Yves, Olivia's protégé, and they begin an affair.
At the same time, she is attracted to the older, wealthy and married Edgar.
The two begin an affair, although Isabel continues to string Yves along.

He also hopes to benefit from the French community property laws in the divorce, especially with regard to a painting owned by his wife's family.
His mistress, Magda Tellman, is married to a man who begins to stalk and harass Roxy, thinking her responsible for his wife's desertion.
Claude-Henri's cruelty and insensitivity take their toll on Roxy, and she attempts suicide in late pregnancy.
She survives and is supported by Isabel and her lawyer.
Roxy and Isabel's parents arrive from the US, which further complicates things when Edgar 's wife, Amelie, discovers the affair through Edgar's sister and Roxy's mother-in-law.
She and Claude-Henri's mother confront, not Isabel, but her mother.
Magda childishly teases her husband with her new relationship, and Claude-Henri is later found dead, murdered by Magda's husband in a crime of passion.
Tellman then follows the sisters on a family outing to the Eifell Tower, where he corners them and pulls a gun, demanding an opportunity to explain to an absent Roxy why he killed her husband.
After some persuasion, the distraught Tellman releases the gun to Isabel, who drops it into a Kelly bag, an expensive gift from Edgar, before throwing it off the Eiffel Tower.
Edgar, persuaded by his socially conscious family's concern, and tiring of his young lover, casually ends his affair with Isabel with a Chanel scarf and a lunch.
After Roxy's baby is born, she marries her lawyer.
Isabel begins a real relationship with Yves.
The disputed family painting of Saint Ursula by Georges de la Tour, rejected by the Louvre as worthless, sells for 45 million Euros, and because its ownership is no longer disputed on Claude-Henri's death, the money goes to the Walker family.

50 First Dates

Henry Roth is a veterinarian at Sea Life Park on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
He has a reputation of womanizing female tourists and does not display any interest in committing to a serious relationship.
Henry's closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; his assistant Alexa, whose gender is unclear; Willy, his pet African penguin; and Jocko, a walrus.
One day Henry’s boat breaks down while he is sailing around Oahu.
He goes to the Hukilau Café to wait for the Coast Guard.
There he sees a young woman named Lucy Whitmore, who makes architectural art with her waffles.
Henry thinks she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, but the next day he comes back.
Lucy and he hit it off instantly and she asks him to meet her again tomorrow morning.
When Henry goes back to the café, Lucy does not have any recollection of ever meeting him.
The restaurant owner Sue (Amy Hill) explains to Henry that one year ago, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday.
On the way back, they had a serious car accident that left Lucy with anterograde amnesia and she wakes up every morning thinking it is October 13, 2002.
To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's lisping steroid-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out October 13's Sunday newspaper, rewatching the same Minnesota Vikings game, and refilling Lucy's shampoo bottles.
Despite Sue's warning, Henry invites Lucy to have breakfast with him.
Eventually she does, but it ends poorly when Henry unintentionally hurts Lucy’s feelings.
He follows her home to apologize where Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone.
Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy on the following days, such as pretending to have car trouble, creating a fake road block, or by having Ula beat him up.
Eventually, Marlin and Doug figure this out due to Lucy singing The Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice" on the days when she meets Henry.
One day, as Henry is about to sit with Lucy at breakfast, she notices a police officer writing her a ticket for her expired plates.
Lucy attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, and takes a newspaper to prove herself, but sees that the date on all the newspapers is not October as she thought.
When she rushes home, Marlin and Doug are forced to admit their ruse (and presumably not for the first time; when Marlin sees Lucy's frantic behavior as her truck pulls up to the house, he immediately realizes what happened and loudly announces to Doug that Lucy "had a bad day").
Henry comes up with an idea to make a video explaining to Lucy her accident and their relationship.
Although Lucy is upset over understanding about her accident and memory loss, Henry believes that she is more upset realizing her life is a lie every day.
Because of this, Henry, Marlin and Doug show Lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off.
She spends more time with Henry and goes to see some of her old friends.
Lucy decides to erase Henry completely from her life after learning of his decision not to take a sailing trip to Bristol Bay to study walruses, something he has been planning for the past 10 years.
Although Henry would rather spend that year making Lucy fall in love with him everyday rather than go on the sailing trip, Lucy is convinced she is a burden on him and is preventing Henry from really living his life.
Henry reluctantly helps Lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship.
A few weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his sailing trip.
Before he departs, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the brain institute and teaching an art class.
He also tells him that she sings.
Then he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD.
Listening to the CD, Henry becomes emotional and curses Marlin for giving him the CD and causing him to miss Lucy.
He then remembers that Marlin once told him that Lucy only sings after she meets him.
Concluding that Lucy remembers him, he returns home.
Henry rushes to the brain institute where Lucy now resides and asks if she knows who he is.
Lucy says she does not know him but shows him the pictures she has painted of him, saying she dreams about him every night.
Some time later, Lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked "Good Morning Lucy".
It again informs her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry’s wedding.
On the tape, Henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready.
Lucy then sees that she is on Henry’s boat, which finally made it to Alaska.
She goes up on deck and meets Marlin, Henry and their daughter, Nicole.

Real Genius

A group of CIA officers watch a video presentation of a top-secret project called "Crossbow": a space shuttle mounted with a computer-guided laser weapon capable of incinerating a man on the ground with pinpoint accuracy.
Researchers on the project have yet to devise a system to generate enough power to operate it.
When it becomes clear that this weapon has no wartime applications and is intended solely for illegal assassinations, one agent decries the project as immoral and refuses to take part.
The remaining agents discuss eliminating the dissenting agent before going to lunch.
Professor Jerry Hathaway meets high school student Mitch Taylor at the school's science fair.
He informs Mitch that he has been admitted to Pacific Technical University, where he will room with physics "legend" Chris Knight.
Hathaway is secretly developing the laser for the CIA, but instead of doing the work himself, he has his unpaid students do it, while misappropriating the project funding to remodel his house.
Arriving on campus, Mitch meets Chris and is disappointed to learn that he is an irreverent slacker who spends his time pulling elaborate high tech pranks.
Mitch also meets Jordan, a hyperkinetic female student, "Ick" Ikagami, a brilliant and affable foil to Chris's antics, and the mysterious Lazlo Hollyfeld, a middle-aged man who seems to be living in Mitch's closet.
Hathaway's sycophantic graduate assistant Kent becomes hostile when Hathaway puts Mitch in charge of the laser project.
Under pressure to get results, Hathaway gives Chris an unrealistic timetable, which Chris dismisses.
When Mitch is caught attending Chris' pool party instead of working in the lab, Hathaway berates him.
The next day Mitch is mortified when a recording of his tearful phone call to his parents is played over a loudspeaker system during lunch, a prank conceived by Kent and his cronies.
Humiliated, Mitch is ready to quit school.
Chris convinces him to stay by explaining to him that Lazlo was the top genius at Pacific Tech in the 1970s, but suffered a breakdown when he learned that his theories were being used to build weapons.
Chris tells Mitch that if he does not want to "crack" like Hollyfeld, he must learn to have fun, and the first order of business is to get even with Kent, calling it a "moral imperative" to do so.
They accomplish this by disassembling Kent's car and rebuilding it inside his dorm room.
Kent vows revenge.
Under increasing pressure from the CIA, Hathaway berates Chris for failing to solve the laser power problem and promises to fail him and prevent him from graduating.
After a pep-talk from Mitch, Chris devotes himself to solving the power problem and achieving a perfect score on Hathaway's final exam.
Mitch is accosted by Sherry Nugel, a beautiful older woman who seeks amorous encounters with the top ten geniuses in the country.
Mitch turns her down, realizing he's in love with Jordan, and the two become a couple.
Though Chris aces Hathway's exam, Chris and Mitch's efforts appear to be ruined when Kent sabotages the laser.
In a fit of anger at the laser's destruction, he has an epiphany that solves the power problem.
The beam of the redesigned laser has unlimited range and produces an estimated six megawatts of power, exceeding the original requirement.
While the team celebrates its success, Lazlo insists that the high-energy laser can only be used as a weapon, and in fact that it must have been conceived for this purpose.
Chris is devastated.
Hathaway has removed the laser from the lab.
Chris, Mitch, Ick and Jordan trick Kent into revealing the date when the laser is going to be tested by placing a microphone in his braces and convincing him that God is talking to him.
The group tails Hathaway to a nearby Air Force base.
While Chris and Mitch talk their way onto the base, Lazlo remotely cracks the laser's computer and changes its target coordinates to Hathaway's house, where the team has placed a huge tin of popcorn.
Meanwhile, Chris and Mitch remove circuits that prevent the laser from overheating.
When the laser beam hits the house, it is diffused by a prism placed by Chris and the popcorn heats and expands; the house bursts at the seams as popcorn pours out onto the lawn.
Kent "rides" the flowing popcorn out of the front door unharmed and laughing, thinking the incident was religious in nature.
The group, reveling in their success, greet an arriving Lazlo accompanied by Sherry, riding in a motor home pulling a trailer full of prizes he won in a sweepstakes.
He and Sherry indicate they intend to run off together as he is the genius she's been looking for all this time.
Hathaway arrives home and in disbelief, assesses his ruined home.

Maskerade

The story begins with Agnes Nitt leaving Lancre to seek a career at the Opera House in Ankh-Morpork.
When Granny Weatherwax realizes Nanny Ogg has written an immensely popular cookbook but has not been paid by the publisher, the witches also leave for Ankh-Morpork to collect the money, as well as to attempt to recruit Agnes into their coven, to replace Magrat Garlick who left the coven when she became Queen of Lancre (in Lords and Ladies).
This has the side benefit of distracting Granny from becoming obsessive and self-centered, or so Nanny believes to her great relief.
Agnes Nitt is chosen as a member of the chorus, where she meets Christine, a more popular but less talented girl.
The Opera House Ghost, who has long haunted the opera house without much incident, begins to commit seemingly random murders staged as "accidents", and also requests that Christine be given lead roles in several upcoming productions.
Due to her incredibly powerful and versatile voice, Agnes is asked to sing the parts from the background, unbeknownst to Christine or the audience.
Having discovered the problems at the opera house and also having coerced the publisher to pay Nanny richly for her book, the witches investigate the mystery, with Granny posing as a rich patron, and Nanny insinuating herself into the opera house staff.
Agnes unmasks Walter Plinge, the janitor, as the ghost, though as he is seemingly harmless, the others are unconvinced.
Another employee is suspected, but turns out to be a member of the Cable Street Particulars.
The witches determine that the finances of the Opera House, which are a complete mess, have been made so intentionally in order to hide the fact that money is being stolen, with the murders being used either as a distraction or to cover evidence.
It is finally revealed that two people had been masquerading as the ghost.
The original (and harmless) ghost, Walter Plinge, was being psychologically manipulated by the second ghost, Mr Salzella (Director of Music at the Opera House), who assumed the identity to commit the murders and theft.
With the witches' help, Walter is able to overcome his fears and help defeat the murderer, who is killed by believing that the fencing staged in opera is actual lethal swordplay, dying despite not actually being injured.
Walter then goes on to become the new Director of Music, integrating his own music into the opera, turning them into musicals.

Mystic Pizza

The film is about the coming of age of two sisters and their friend through the romantic lives of the three main characters: Kat Arujo (Annabeth Gish), Daisy Arujo (Julia Roberts), and Jojo Barbosa (Lili Taylor), who are waitresses at Mystic Pizza in Mystic, Connecticut.
In the film, Mystic is represented as a fishing town with a large Portuguese-American population.
The film also touches on an Old World work ethic.
Kat and Daisy are sisters and rivals: Kat studies astronomy, works at the planetarium in the famous Whaling Museum of The Mystic Seaport, as well as the restaurant, and has been accepted to attend Yale University on a partial scholarship.
Daisy just wants to find love through lust while trying to get out of Mystic.
Kat is the apple of her Portuguese mother's eye, while Daisy is not because her mother feels she is more wild and is not as goal-oriented as her younger sister.
Daisy meets a handsome young man named Charles (Adam Storke) at a bar, and the two are immediately attracted to each other, and begin a relationship, much to her mother's dismay, believing that the relationship will prevent her making something of herself like Kat.
However, at a family dinner, his relatives unintentionally make insensitive comments about her ethnicity, and Charles overreacts.
Daisy breaks up with him, believing that his family's remarks were harmless and that he was simply using her to show up his parents.
There is also chemistry between Kat and her Anglo-American employer, Tim (William Moses), a father who has hired her to look after his young daughter, Phoebe, while his wife is away.
A relationship develops between them, and they eventually make love, but it results in heartache for Kat when the wife returns and her illusion of an actual relationship with Tim is shattered.
Daisy and Kat bond when Kat is devastated after Tim's and her evening together and Daisy comforts her baby sister.
Jojo is trying to have sex with her boyfriend Bill (Vincent D'Onofrio), whom she attempted to marry at the beginning of the movie, but fainted after deciding she couldn't go through with it.
However, Bill refuses to have sex with her until they are married, which is something she still isn't ready for.
Seeing how she tries to look for every chance to have sex with him, Bill believes that Jojo doesn't love him like he does her, and is only after him for sex, and breaks up with her.
After all those events, at work, a famous TV food critic, nicknamed "The Fireside Gourmet" (Louis Turenne), comes to the pizzeria to sample a pizza.
Not showing any emotion towards the pizza that he eats, he leaves after eating only a few bites, leaving the girls in suspense.
However, a few days later, the critic gives the pizzeria his highest rating, calling it "superb".
In the end, Kat receives her last paycheck from Tim (which she tears up and throws away), and never sees him again.
Jojo finally agrees to marry Bill, and at their wedding, Daisy and Charles reconcile.
The film ends with the three girls together overlooking the water from the balcony of the restaurant, reminiscing about their time together.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

Shy, soft-spoken Joel Barish and the unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York to Rockville Centre.
They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their different personalities, though both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day.
Although they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together.
After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc.
to erase all of her memories of their relationship.
Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.
Much of the film subsequently takes place in Joel's mind, during this memory erasure procedure.
As his memories are erased, he tries to evade the erasing effects of the procedure by hiding Clementine in remote parts of his subconscious.
Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse.
Upon seeing happier times of love with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her.
Despite his efforts to either hide the memories or wake up and stop the process, the memories are slowly erased.
He comes to the last remaining memory of Clementine, the day he had first met her at a beach house in Montauk.
As this memory disintegrates around them, she tells him, "Meet me in Montauk".
Separate, but related, story arcs, which revolve around the employees of Lacuna, are revealed during Joel's memory erasure.
Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, uses Joel's memories and mannerisms to seduce Clementine.
Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan.
During Joel's memory wipe, Mary discovers she had previously had an affair with dr Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the company, and had agreed to have this erased from her memory when dr Mierzwiak's wife found out.
On learning this, she asks Stan whether he knew about this, to which he claims that he didn't.
Mary then quits her job and steals the company's records, and mails the two former clients their records from Lacuna.
The film returns to the present, after Joel and Clementine have met aboard the train.
They both come upon their Lacuna records later that day, and react with shock and bewilderment, because they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased.
Joel beckons Clementine to start over; Clementine initially resists, pointing out it could go the same way.
Joel accepts this, and they decide to attempt a relationship anyway, starting their life together anew.

Strictly Ballroom

Strictly Ballroom tells the story of an Australian ballroom dancer, Scott Hastings (Paul Mercurio), and his struggle to establish his personal style of dance on his way to win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship.
Scott's steps are not strictly ballroom.
Scott comes from a family with a history of ballroom dancing and has been training since childhood.
Scott's mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio.
After losing a competition to a rival pair, because Scott started dancing his own steps, his dancing partner Liz Holt (Gia Carides) leaves him for the rival male, Ken Railings, after his partner Pam Short breaks both her legs in a car accident.
With only weeks before the next Pan-Pacific competition, try-outs begin to find Scott a new dance partner but, unknown to his parents, Scott secretly begins rehearsing with frumpy outsider Fran (Tara Morice), a beginner dancer at his parents' studio.
Scott is initially sceptical, but when Fran introduces pasodoble steps into their routine, Scott realises her potential.
He walks her home one night and finds her Spanish family living in a tiny home next to the railway tracks, where Fran's family show him the authentic Spanish pasodoble style.
As their rehearsals progress, Fran grows more attractive and self-confident.
A few days before the Pan-Pacifics, Fran's family decide they are ready to dance pasodoble.
Scott and Fran are walking together and talking until they kiss, as they were already in love.
When Scott returns to the dance studio, he finds Barry Fife, the conniving president of the Australian Dancing Federation who proceeds to tell him "the truth" about his parents, Doug and Shirley — they too were ballroom dancing champions, especially his father, until they lost the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix because of Doug's self-obsession and unorthodox dance steps.
According to Barry losing the contest left Doug a broken man, sustained by the hope that one day his son would learn from his father's mistakes and win the Grand Prix.
Scott is convinced to dance with Liz instead of Fran so he can win "for his father's sake".
However, this is later revealed as a lie, part of Barry's plot to fix the competition so Scott and Liz will lose.
Scott starts training with Liz, while a heart-broken Fran goes back to the beginners' class.
At the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix, Scott's friend Wayne Burns and his partner Vanessa Cronin overhear Fife talking to Ken and his partner Tina Sparkle saying that they will win no matter what.
Wayne tells Les Kendall (Scott's coach, Doug and Shirley's friend and one of the judges) who then confronts Fife about it.
Meanwhile, Doug finally manages to pull Scott aside and tells him the real story — Doug never danced at the competition because Barry convinced Shirley the only way to win was to dance the conventional steps with Les, but Shirley and Les lost the contest anyway.
After hearing his father's revelation, Scott finds Fran and asks her to dance with him.
Fife tries to cut the music and stop them from dancing but Scott's sister Kylie and her partner Luke (from the children's division) interfere until Fife's loyal companion Charm Leachman cuts the music.
Fife then disqualifies them, but Doug, along with Fran's family, claps out a beat which encourages Scott and Fran to "dance from the heart", drawing cheers from the crowd and tears of joy from Doug.
Finally, Liz, having had a change of heart, turns on Barry and Leachman and restores the music.
The couple's spirited dancing brings down the house.
Doug asks Shirley to dance with him and the whole audience joins them on the floor.
As the performance finishes, Scott and Fran kiss, the competition forgotten, as it was never about winning or losing.

Back home, Reuben tries talking to Polly, but to no avail.
He eventually invites Lisa to Sandy's opening show, where he learns that Polly is leaving New York for Cincinnati in a few hours.
After a speech given by his father, Irving (Bob Dishy), to Sandy about not living in the past, Reuben realizes he wants to be with Polly and not Lisa, and he rushes to her apartment to stop her from leaving.
Polly is not convinced she should stay with him, so Reuben eats food off the ground to prove he is capable of taking risks.
Reuben and Polly vacation on the same beach where Lisa and he had their honeymoon.
Reuben again encounters Claude, but instead of being angry, he thanks Claude before heading into the water with Polly to join Van Lew on his new boat.

She soon finds herself writing an article called "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days".
The idea comes about when Andie's friend, Michelle (Kathryn Hahn), experiences a minor breakdown after yet another break-up.
Using her friend as inspiration, Andie reveals how she will actually start dating a guy and drive him away but "only using the classic mistakes women make".
At the same time, advertising executive Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is striving for a pitch to advertise diamonds.
When they question Ben's knowledge about love, Ben bets he could make any woman fall in love with him if he wanted to.
If he can make any woman fall in love with him before the upcoming company ball, in just 10 days, he can head the advertising for the new diamond company.
Ben's rival co-workers, Judy Spears (Michael Michele) and Judy Green (Shalom Harlow), who were at Composure magazine earlier and are aware of Andie's new assignment, conspire to have Andie and Ben meet that night and start their quests.
Fortunately, that night Andie and Ben happen to be in the same place and as Judy and Judy refer to Andie as "the blonde with the pretty smile", Ben thinks it is a done deal.
Neither Andie nor Ben reveals their true intentions.
Andie works hard to make Ben break up with her in order to complete her article.
However, Ben continues to stick around in hopes of making her fall in love with him.
Andie goes on to get Ben knocked out at a chick flick, rapidly moves her things into his apartment, acts overly possessive and sensitive at all times, ruins boys' poker night for him and his friends, and takes him to a Celine Dion concert when he was under the assumption he was going to see a New York Knicks basketball game.

Around the same time, Andie and Ben go to the company ball together where Ben's boss, Phillip (Robert Klein), meets Andie and tells Ben that he "met her, she loves you, you win".
Seeing Ben's good news, Judy and Judy are instantly envious and set about to ruin it for their co-worker.
They tell his close colleagues, Tony (Adam Goldberg) and Thayer (Thomas Lennon), Andie knew about the bet all along and was playing along to help Ben win.
Almost instantly, Tony and Thayer rush to Andie's side and beg her to keep quiet, when they do not realize she is still blissfully unaware.
Almost simultaneously, Lana—who is unaware of Ben's role in Andie's "How To" article—reveals Andie's true intentions to Ben.
Upon learning of Ben's bet, Andie attempts to humiliate Ben by getting on stage and telling all he has prepared a "special treat": to sing a song.
In an attempt to leave, Ben reveals they have prepared a "duet" and instructs his friends not to let her leave the room.
They go on to sing a poor version of Carly Simon's "You're So Vain", which they describe as "one of their personal favourites".
They go their separate ways before Ben is shown Andie's article and encouraged to read it.
She explains in it how she "lost the one person she ever fell for", and when he hears she quit her job at Composure and is on her way to Washington,C.
for an interview, he chases her taxi and stops her.
Once he accuses her of running away, they reveal their true feelings for each other and the film ends with Ben instructing the taxi driver to return Andie's belongings to her home, and then they kiss.

The Wedding Banquet

Wai-Tung Gao and Simon are a happy gay couple living in Manhattan.
Wai-Tung is in his late 20s, so his tradition-minded parents are eager to see him get married and have a child in order to continue the family line.
When Wai-Tung's parents hire a dating service, he and Simon stall for time by inventing impossible demands.
They demand an opera singer and add that she must be 5'9", have two PhDs, and speak five languages.
The service actually locates a 5'8" Chinese woman who sings Western opera, speaks five languages and has a single PhD.
She is very gracious when Wai-Tung explains his dilemma, as she, too, is hiding a relationship (with a Caucasian man).
At Simon's insistence, Wai-Tung decides to marry one of his tenants, Wei-Wei, a penniless artist from mainland China in need of a green card.
Besides helping Wei-Wei, Simon and Wai-Tung hope that this will placate Wai-Tung's parents.
Before Wai-Tung's parents arrive, Simon tells Wei-Wei everything she needs to know about Wai-Tung's habits, body, and lifestyle, and the three take down all homosexual content from their house and replace it with traditional Chinese scrolls.
mr and mrs Gao announce they will visit from Taiwan, bringing gifts and US$30,000 to hold an extravagant wedding for their son.
Wai-Tung dares not tell his parents the truth, because his father, a retired officer in the Chinese Nationalist Army, has just recovered from a stroke.
As a part of the lie, Wai-Tung introduces Simon as his landlord.
A day after Wai-Tung's parents arrive, he announces that Wei-Wei and he are planning to get their marriage certificate at city hall.
However, the heartbreak his mother experiences at the courthouse wedding prepares the story for a shift to drama.
The only way to atone for the disgraceful wedding is a magnificent wedding banquet, offered by mr Gao's former driver in the army who now owns a restaurant and reception hall.
After the banquet, Wei-Wei has sex with a drunken Wai-Tung, and becomes pregnant.
Simon is extremely upset when he finds out, and his relationship with Wai-Tung begins to deteriorate.
Shortly after, mr Gao has another stroke, and in a moment of anger, after a fight with both Simon and Wei-Wei, Wai-Tung admits the truth to his mother.
She is shocked and insists that he not tell his father.
However, the perceptive mr Gao has seen more than he is letting on; he secretly tells Simon that he knows about their relationship, and, appreciating the considerable sacrifices he made for his biological son, takes Simon as his son as well.
Simon accepts the Hongbao from Wai-Tung's father, a symbolic admission of their relationship.
mr Gao seeks and receives Simon's promise not to tell his secret for, as he points out, without the sham marriage, he'd never have a grandchild.
While en route to an appointment for an abortion, Wei-Wei decides to keep the baby, and asks Simon to stay together with Wai-Tung and be the baby's second father.
In the final parting scene, as Wai-Tung's parents prepare to fly home, mrs Gao has forged an emotional bond to daughter-in-law Wei-Wei.
mr Gao accepts Simon and warmly shakes his hand.
In the end, both derive some happiness from the situation, and they walk off to board the aircraft, leaving the unconventional family to sort itself out.

The Nutty Professor

Professor Julius Kelp is a nerdy, scruffy, buck-toothed, accident-prone, socially awkward university professor whose experiments in the classroom laboratory are unsuccessful and highly destructive.
When a football-playing bully embarrasses and attacks him, Kelp decides to "beef up" by joining a local gym.
Kelp's lack of physical strength prompts him to invent a serum that turns him into the handsome, suave, charming and cheeky girl-chasing hipster, Buddy Love.
This new personality gives him the self-confidence to pursue one of his students, Stella Purdy.
Although she resents Love, she finds herself strangely attracted to him.
Buddy wows the crowd with his jazzy, breezy musical delivery and poised demeanor at the Purple Pit, a nightclub where the students hang out.
He also mocks a bartender and waitress and punches a student.
The formula wears off at inopportune times, often to Kelp's humiliation.
Although Kelp knows that his alternate persona is a bad person, he cannot prevent himself from continually taking the formula as he enjoys the attention that Love receives.
As Buddy performs at the annual student dance the formula starts to wear off.
His real identity now revealed, Kelp gives an impassioned speech, admitting his mistakes and seeking forgiveness.
Kelp says that the one thing he learned from being someone else is that if you don't like yourself, you can't expect others to like you.
Purdy meets Kelp backstage, and confesses that she prefers Kelp over Buddy Love.
Eventually, Kelp's formerly timid father chooses to market the formula (a copy of which Kelp had sent to his parents' home for safekeeping), endorsed by the deadpan president of the university who proclaims, "It's a gasser.
" Kelp's father makes a pitch to the chemistry class, and the students all rush forward to buy the new tonic.
In the confusion Kelp and Purdy slip out of the class.
Armed with a marriage license and two bottles of the formula, they elope.
During the short closing credits, each of the characters come out and bow down to the camera, and when Jerry Lewis, still portraying Kelp, comes out and bows, he trips and goes into the camera, breaking it and causing the picture to go black.

Mr. Deeds

Multibillionaire Preston Blake freezes to death while on a mountain climbing expedition.
With no widow or legitimate children, it is initially unclear who would earn the right to Blake's massive fortune.
It is found that Blake has a living grandnephew named Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), who runs a pizzeria in New Hampshire and also writes greeting cards in the hopes that Hallmark may be interested in one.
Deeds is contacted and flown to New York City by businessman Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher), who is temporarily in control of Blake Media.
Deeds' unorthodox helicopter trip includes a stop at a Wendy's for a Frosty as well as a singing of David Bowie's Space Oddity.
Once Deeds arrives in New York, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer, but he must remain in New York for a few days while all the legal details are worked out.
The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), who works for a tabloid show called Inside Access, has a co-worker pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds, because their research indicated that Deeds wanted to meet a girl by "rescuing" her, the same way his father had met his mother.
Deeds does so, and beats up her "robber", and Babe goes out with him under the disguise of Pam Dawson, a school nurse from a made-up town called Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa (which later turns out to be a real town, which Babe is flabbergasted to find out).
Though Babe initially hopes to just get a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the unfailingly kind-hearted Deeds, and decides to tell him that she is not who she says she is, but Inside Access, in concert with Cedar (who was fed the truth by the fake robber and was smitten with Babe) reveals it to Deeds first.
Heartbroken and upset, Deeds decides to return home to Mandrake Falls and makes plans to donate his $40 billion inheritance to the United Negro College Fund.
After returning to Mandrake Falls, he learns from Crazy Eyes (Steve Buscemi) that Cedar intends to sell off the company, which will cause thousands of people to lose their jobs (Cedar had convinced Longfellow to sell his shares by lying that he will work commanding the company in honor of Preston's lifetime of work).
Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back, but after saving her life when she falls through the ice over a lake, he rejects her, saying he does not really know who she is.
At a shareholders meeting, Cedar has everyone convinced to sell the company, until Deeds (who has bought a single share) arrives and manages to convince everyone not to sell.
But Cedar claims control of a majority of the shares and the sale is approved.
Bennett arrives and reveals that Emilio Lopez, Preston Blake's longtime butler is his illegitimate son and the true heir as a result of a younger Preston having an amorous affair with his maid in 1958 (at one point he had told Deeds that Blake treated him "like a son").
Realizing Emilio is his cousin, Deeds convinces him they must stop Cedar and that he is the rightful CEO.
As a result of Emilio supplanting Longfellow as the heir, Deeds' sale of shares are retracted and Cedar is fired.
Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media.
Babe then reconciles with and kisses Deeds after professing her love for him.
As they leave the meeting, Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and offers him a billion dollars, some of which Deeds spends on red Corvettes for everyone in Mandrake Falls.
When he returns to the pizzeria with Babe, he learns that Hallmark is interested in buying one of his greeting cards: the one he wrote for Babe when he professed his love for her.
They both share a kiss as the movie ends with Crazy Eyes crashing his Corvette and coming out unharmed.

13 Going on 30

On May 26, 1987, Jenna Rink, a gawky girl, yearns to be popular, but the only way she can get the ruling clique - the "Six Chicks," led by the arrogant Lucy "Tom-Tom" Wyman - to attend her upcoming 13th birthday party is by doing their homework.
Jenna's best friend, the geeky boy Matty Flamhaff, (with the horrible nickname of Beaver because he looks like the star of "Leave It To Beaver") arrives early to the party to give her a bright pink, dream dollhouse that he built for her.
He sprinkles his second gift, a packet of glittery "magic wishing dust".
on its roof.
The Six Chicks soon show up with the cutest boys in class and make Jenna play "Seven Minutes in Heaven" While Jenna waits, blindfolded, in a dark closet, thinking a popular boy she has a crush on is about to enter, the Six Chicks vanish with all the boys, half the food and Jenna's completed homework.
It's Matt who walks into the closet, to Jenna's horror.
She locks herself in the closet and cries, wishing to be 30; above her, the glittering wishing dust from the dollhouse gently rains down.
The next morning, Jenna awakens in a gleaming Fifth Avenue apartment.
Jenna's dream has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna, at first utterly baffled, particularly by the handsome hunk in her shower, realises she's magically turned thirty overnight, with no idea of what happened in the intervening seventeen years.
Jenna discovers that she works for Poise, her favourite fashion magazine.
Tough-as-nails Lucy is her co-editor and best friend, but the magazine itself is in serious trouble, having been scooped by a rival magazine named Sparkle so often that the editor-in-chief believes someone inside Poise is tipping them off.
Jenna, freaking out like the frightened teen she still is, wants only to find Matty.
She gets his address and races down to the Village where the now-grown Matt (Mark Ruffalo) is a struggling photographer.
To her confusion, he's distant and cold, and can't even fill Jenna on much of her missing past, because she became head of the "Six Chicks," and never spoke to Matt again.
She even became Prom Queen - and Lucy, her only friend, is actually the original "Tom-Tom' after plastic surgery.
While delighting in her freedom and great clothes, Jenna stumbles through a grown-up world, learning enough of life to advise other 13-year-olds whom she actually prefers to hang with.
But her slowly-emerging past reveals she was nothing like the sweet, shy girl she'd been the day before: this grown-up Jenna stole ideas, refused to speak to her parents, has office sex with the husband of a co-worker.
After Jenna overhears her supposed best friend Lucy badmouthing her, in a plan to save the magazine behind her back, she resolves to fix the sins of the past she can't remember.
She returns to her hometown in New Jersey and weeps in the same basement closet.
Her parents find her there, and they hug.
She gets back in touch with Matt, gingerly apologises and hires him to do the photography on her own new plans for Poise, which is a huge break for him.
Even though Matt has a fiancée in Chicago who's eager for him to move there, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other.
Everyone loves Matt's photos and Jenna's new plans to save the magazine, but when Sparkle shows up yet again with this exact material, including Matt's own photographs, and with Lucy as their new head, Poise folds.
Outraged, Jenna confronts Lucy for stealing, but Lucy scornfully tells her that Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine all along; Lucy merely found out about it and did the same thing.
Matt, wounded by what he thought was Jenna's betrayal of him, is getting married the next day.
Jenna rushes out to the leafy suburb on his wedding day, hoping to convince Matt that she wasn't the person she'd seemed to be, that he'd marry her if he could see who she really was, but Matt, already in his tux, says the past can't come back and hands Jenna her pink homemade dollhouse, which he'd kept all these years.
While the wedding begins in the background, Jenna leaves in tears, closing her eyes and clinging to the dollhouse -- on which a few bits of wishing dust still remain.
When Jenna opens her eyes, she's back in 1987, on that same 13th birthday night.
This time, when Matt finds her huddled alone in the closet, she kisses him.
They run upstairs together, bumping into Tom-Tom on the way, Jenna rips up the homework in Tom-Tom's hands and Jenna and Matt run out of the house, emerging as a wedding couple on the other side of the door, and, as credits roll, they're moving into a bright pink house just like the dollhouse that started it all.

The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas

Young bachelors and best friends Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble have recently qualified as crane operators at Slate & Company.
Soon to be employed, now they want dates, and little green alien The Great Gazoo, exiled to Earth by his species, offers to help, although only they can see him.
Meanwhile, Wilma Slaghoople wants a normal life and activities, like bowling, despite her controlling mother Pearl, who wants her to marry smooth casino-owner Chip Rockefeller.
Wilma angrily runs away to Bronto King in Bedrock.
Waitress Betty O'Shale mistakes her as "caveless", and offers to share her apartment, and gets her a job.
Fred and Barney are smitten with the waitresses and invite them to a carnival, with Fred dating Betty and Barney taking Wilma.
Fred wins a carnival game and gets a prize of an egg which hatches into a baby dinosaur, which he names "Dino".
However, he does not really feel a connection with Betty, nor does Barney with Wilma, until both men switch dates.
Wilma invites her new friends home to a birthday party for her father, Colonel Slaghoople, where all are shocked by her wealth.
Fred intends to propose, but changes his mind after meeting Chip, who berates him for his low-level job at Slate & Company.
Pearl dislikes the three new friends, but the Colonel accepts them, glad Wilma is happy, and privately gives her a valuable pearl necklace that once belonged to his great-grandmother.
After the boys disgrace themselves at dinner, Wilma nevertheless proclaims her pride and follows them out.
Chip congratulates Fred on attracting Wilma and apologizes for his humiliation of Fred's job.
He invites the four to his Rock Vegas resort as a peace offering.
However, this is a plot by Chip to hope Fred gambles so Wilma dumps him, whereas Fred sees it as a chance to win big so he can impress Wilma with money like Chip's.
Chip and his girlfriend Roxie are visited by two gangsters named Big Rocko and Little Rocko to collect a lot of money owed by Chip, who claims his upcoming marriage to Wilma will get him access to the Slaghoople fortune, and the gangsters consider that plan creditable, so they agree to suspend collections until after the wedding.
Gazoo witnesses the entire conversation.
When Barney tries to keep Fred from high-stakes poker, Chip sends Roxie to seduce Barney for an escort to an all-you-can-eat buffet.

Betty sees Barney wipe cream from Roxie's chest and misinterprets the move as a pass.
Mick Jagged comforts the weeping girl, and they go on a date.
Wilma breaks up with Fred over not spending any time with her.
Chip warns her of burglaries and arranges that Fred loses everything before slipping Wilma's pearls in Fred's pocket and asking him to empty them.
Hotel security arrests Fred for robbery.
When Barney protests that Fred would do no such thing, and that Fred would not even be able to crack his own knuckles without help, Chip accuses Barney of being Fred's accomplice and has him arrested, as well.
Angered that the two of them stole from her, Wilma goes back to Chip.
In prison, the men are visited by Gazoo, who earlier spied on Chip.
Gazoo reveals that Chip is in severe debt to the mob, and hoped to solve both his problems by framing Fred for the robbery and plans to marry Wilma to get the Slaghooples' money.
Barney slips through the bars, steals the keys, and unlocks the cell.
Disguised as dancers, they accidentally run into Jagged's dressing room.
Barney tells Betty he loves her, and they get back together.
Fred plans to disguise himself as Jagged in an attempt to reconcile with Wilma.
Meanwhile, in the audience, Chip proposes to Wilma, but she is unresponsive.
Fred then comes on stage disguised as Jagged and briefly sings to Wilma.
He apologizes for his behavior earlier before proposing to her.
Wilma happily accepts, rejecting Chip, and they marry in the Rock Vegas Chapel of Love, while the gangsters prepare to make Chip pay in their own manner.
After the pastor proclaims them husband and wife, everyone sings "Meet the Flintstones".
When Jagged sings "Viva Rock Vegas" at a party, Betty catches Wilma's tossed bouquet and kisses Barney.
The newlyweds drive away with Dino and Gazoo to goodbye waves from their friends, family, and even Chip and Roxie.

Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!

The film opens with a soldier and nurse getting out of two 1940-style cars in the middle of night.
The nurse runs up to the soldier and the camera switches to reveal this to be a scene from a film.
The three Piggly Wiggly store workers—Rosalee, Cathy, and Pete—are watching and as the nurse on screen asks for forgiveness and the soldier agrees, the women in the audience are moved to tears as Pete is clearly unimpressed.
As the girls wonder what Tad Hamilton—the star of the film—is doing at that moment, their prediction of praying is proven false as the scene cuts to Tad—described in the next scene by his agent—"drinking, driving, smoking, leering, and groping all at the same time".
The conclusion of the agent scene is that Tad must clean up his act to convince a director to cast him in an upcoming film; the solution, a competition to win a date with Tad, is found out by Rosalee as she surfs the internet.
With the help of the Piggly Wiggly customers and the reluctant agreement of Pete, the girls raise the $100 entrance money as Pete reveals to his superior that he will leave for Richmond to go to college after he has a discussion "with someone about going to Richmond with me".
This person is obviously Rosalee, but a news crew outside her house signals her success at winning a date with Tad Hamilton, and as Pete sees her off at the airport he sadly warns her to guard her "carnal treasure".
Rosalee is awed by Los Angeles and becomes tongue-tied in Tad's presence; the date does not go well as Rosalee throws up in the limo and Tad mentioning his love of animals—which Pete had warned was a signal of sexual intentions—rouses her suspicions.
After seeing Tad's house, Rosalee requests to go back to the hotel and soon returns home leaving Tad thoughtful.
As Pete is about to tell Rosalee about moving to Richmond she is surprised—as much as Pete is disappointed—by Tad's sudden arrival to get to know her and have some of her goodness rub off on him.
Though Rosalee is still cynical of him as he uses a line from one of his films, his admission of not having "his priorities straight" seems to convince her of his good intentions.
During a phone call with his agent, Tad insists that he wants to turn over a new leaf, and will not return to Los Angeles for a while.
When he picks Rosalee up for a date he leaves a good impression on Rosalee's father, who had studied hard for the encounter.
Pete tries to stop Rosalee seeing Tad by reporting the pair for parking at the infamous Water Gap, convincing her that Tad is just using her, and directly competing with Tad in farmyard chores; despite all his efforts, Rosalee and Tad grow close over the next few days.
In the bar, Pete corners Tad in the men's room and after giving up the competition for Rosalee's love tells Tad that Rosalee is more than a wholesome small town girl, she is a wonderful person with "the kind of beauty a guy only sees once".
He explains about her six smiles: one smile when something makes her laugh, one for polite laughter, one for when she makes plans, one when she makes fun of herself, one when she's uncomfortable, and one when she's talking about her friends.
He makes Tad swear not to break her heart or he will tear Tad to pieces with his "vicious rhetoric".
When the pair is in Tad's hotel room, his agents appear and inform him that the director has decided to cast him in the film after all.
Tad is overjoyed and convinces her to come to LA with him by using Pete's "six smile" speech.
After a rousing speech about great love from Angelica, a barmaid with a crush on him, Pete rushes to Rosalee's house and confesses his love for her but she is confused and resolves to still go to LA with Tad.
On the plane when Tad fails to identify one of Rosalee's smiles, he confesses his lie and she asks to go home.
She runs to Piggly Wiggly and Pete's house, then drives furiously towards Richmond to overtake her heartbroken friend.
And, in a set-up similar to the opening scene, Rosalee and Pete get out of their cars and Pete, surrendering to cheesy romance, asks her to dance.

In Greece, with just a little effort on her part, she rediscovers everything she had been missing about her existence in England.

Coping with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone-sex line, but the operator attempts to extort money and sends her four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect.

He arrives and calls one of his manipulative sisters to learn where Lena is staying.
When his sister starts abusing him again, Barry snaps and demands she give him the information, which she does.

Suspecting that Lena will leave him if she finds out about the phone-sex fiasco, Barry leaves Lena at the hospital and tries to end the harassment by calling the phone-sex line back and speaking to the "supervisor", who turns out to be Dean Trumbell, who is also the owner of a mattress store.
Barry travels to the mattress store in Provo, Utah, to confront Dean face to face.
Dean, at first trying to intimidate Barry, finds Barry much more intimidating and Barry compels Dean to leave him alone.
Barry decides to tell Lena about his phone-sex episode and begs her for forgiveness, pledging his loyalty and to use his frequent-flier miles to accompany her on all future business trips.
She readily agrees, and they embrace happily.
Some time later, Lena approaches Barry in his office while he plays the harmonium.
She puts her arms around him and says, "So, here we go".

Cutthroat Island

In 1668 Jamaica, Morgan Adams (Geena Davis) hunts down her uncle and fellow pirate Dawg Brown (Frank Langella), who has captured her father, Black Harry (Harris Yulin).
Black Harry has one of three pieces of a map to a huge stash of gold on the remote Cutthroat Island.
Dawg has another piece, having stolen it from the corpse of a third brother, Richard, while a fourth brother, Mordechai (George Murcell), has the last piece.
Harry refuses to give Dawg his piece and escapes with Morgan's help, but not before being mortally wounded.
A dying Harry reveals to his daughter the location of the map piece: on his scalp.
After scalping her dead father for the piece, Morgan, now the captain of her father's ship, the Morning Star, sets out for the treasure.
Unfortunately, the instructions appear to be in Latin, which no one on board reads.
So, they go to nearby Port Royal to find a translator.
There, they learn that one of the slaves up for auction, a con man and thief named William Shaw (Matthew Modine), is fluent in Latin.
After threatening a man determined to outbid her, Morgan wins the auction.
Unfortunately, she is recognized from her wanted poster and is chased out of town (which is demolished), along with her crew and Shaw.
Humiliated, corrupt Governor Ainslee (Patrick Malahide) vows to find her, either to arrest her or form a partnership for half her profits.
He enlists the help of chronicler John Reed (Maury Chaykin), who often follows pirates to write his books.
The crew then goes to Mordechai in Spittlefield Harbor.
Before they can learn where the second piece is, Dawg appears.
A fight ensues, during which Mordechai is killed and Morgan is shot, while Shaw secretly finds the piece and keeps it to himself.
After they escape on the Morning Star, Morgan collapses from her wound, but is saved by Shaw, who is a self-proclaimed doctor.

Morgan figures out that the words on the map, when read backwards, spell out half the coordinates to the island.
Dawg's ship, the Reaper, bears down on them.
Morgan directs hers toward a coral reef.
and a gale.
Shaw manages to piece together the location of Cutthroat Island with his and Morgan's piece, but is caught and thrown in the brig.
During the storm, Reed sends a carrier pigeon revealing their location to Ainslee.
Meanwhile, the majority of the crew led by the treacherous Scully (Jimmie Skaggs) mutinies against Morgan and maroon her and those loyal to her in a boat.
Fortuitously, though the boat is wrecked the tide takes them straight to Cutthroat Island, which is uncharted land northeast of Cuba.
As Morgan goes after the treasure, Shaw, who escaped during the storm, steals the last piece from Dawg, who's on the island.
Shaw falls into quicksand and Morgan, realizing he has the piece, frees him.
Together, they find the gold, only for it to be stolen by Dawg, forcing them to jump off a cliff into the tide.
After regaining consciousness, Shaw finds Reed, who leads him into a trap set by Dawg, Ainslee, and the mutineers, who have joined forces and intend to split the gold between them.

Bull Durham

"Crash" Davis (Costner), a veteran of 12 years in minor league baseball, is sent down to the single-A Durham Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Robbins, playing a character loosely based on Steve Dalkowski) about becoming a major-league talent, and to control Ebby's haphazard pitching.
Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of "Meat", and they get off to a rocky start.
Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a "baseball groupie" and lifelong spiritual seeker who has latched onto the "Church of Baseball" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student.
Annie flirts with both Crash and Ebby and invites them to her house, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to "try out" for anything.
Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech listing the things he "believes in", ending with "I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days.
Good night".
Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher.
Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname "Nuke").
Crash forces Nuke to learn "not to think" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure of facing major league hitters who can hit his "heat" (fastballs).
Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in "The Show" (Major League Baseball), which he briefly lived for "the 21 greatest days of my life" and to which he has tried for years to return.
Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple.
After a rough start, Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season.
By the end of the movie, Nuke is called up to the majors.
This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke's failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with.
Nuke leaves for the big leagues, Annie ends their relationship, and Crash overcomes his jealousy to leave Nuke with some final words of advice.
The Bulls, now having no use for his mentor, release Crash.
Crash then presents himself at Annie's house and the two consummate their attraction with a weekend-long lovemaking session.
Crash then leaves Annie's house to seek a further minor-league position.
Crash joins another team, the Asheville Tourists, and breaks the minor-league record for career home runs.
We see Nuke one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clichéd answers that Crash had taught him earlier.
Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she's ready to give up her annual affairs with "boys".
Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor-league team in Visalia.
The film ends with Annie and Crash dancing in Annie's candle-lit living room.

Teen Wolf

Scott Howard is a seventeen-year-old high school student who is sick of being average.
Living in a small town, his only claim to popularity is playing on the Beavers; his school's basketball team (which is very unsuccessful) and fawning after his crush Pamela Wells, who is dating his rival Mick.
Mick plays for the Dragons, an opposing team who tends to bully Scott on the court.
Completely oblivious to his best friend Boof's affections, he constantly rebuffs her advances due to their history together.
After a series of startling changes such as long hair suddenly sprouting, hands suddenly getting hairy, he decides to quit the team, but his coach changes his mind.
Scoring a keg with his friend Stiles for a party, Scott and Boof end up alone in a closet and Scott gets rough when they begin making out, accidentally clawing Boof's back.
When he returns home, he undergoes a strange transformation and discovers he is a werewolf.
His father Harold confronts him and reveals he too is a werewolf, and that he'd hoped Scott wouldn't inherit the curse because "sometimes it skips a generation".
Scott reveals his secret to Stiles, who agrees to keep it a secret, but when Scott becomes stressed on the court at the next basketball game, he becomes the wolf and helps win their first game in three years.
This has an unexpected result of fame and popularity as the high school is overwhelmed with "Wolf Fever", which quickly alienates Scott from Boof and from his teammates as he begins to hog the ball during games.
Stiles merchandises "Teen Wolf" paraphernalia and Pamela finally begins paying attention to Scott.
After he gets a role as a 'werewolf cavalryman' in the school play alongside her, she comes onto him in the dressing room and the two have sex.
Later, after a date set up to intentionally make Mick jealous, Pamela tells Scott that she's still seeing him and is not interested in Scott as a boyfriend, much to his disappointment.
Harold tells Scott he is responsible for vice principal Rusty Thorne breathing down his neck, due to a scare he'd given him when he was in high school, and advises him to be himself and not the wolf.
With the upcoming spring dance, Boof agrees to go with Scott, but only if he goes as himself, not the Wolf.
Scott goes by himself as the Wolf and has a great time.
Boof, however, isn't impressed.

The Terminal

Viktor Navorski, a traveler from Krakozhia, arrives at New York's John Kennedy International Airport, only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid due to the sudden outbreak of a civil war in his homeland.
As a result, the United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation, and he is no longer permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now considered to be stateless.
Due to his inability to communicate in proper English, the airport's branch of the US Customs and Border Protection seize both his passport and airline ticket, whereupon its temporary director, Frank Dixon, makes him stay in the terminal he came through.
Left with no other choice, Viktor decides to settle in at a closed off section of the terminal, Gate 67, with only his luggage and a peanut can, soon making a home out of it.
Much to the frustration of Dixon, who is being considered for promotion to director of the US Customs branch, Viktor chooses not to break out of the terminal but wait patiently until he can legally enter the United States.
Dixon, who wants him to illegally attempt to enter the country so he can deport him, decides to try finding ways to make it difficult for him to survive in the terminal, slowly becoming obsessed in doing so.
During his initial days at the terminal, Viktor encounters and helps out a flight attendant named Amelia Warren after she slips on a wet floor and breaks the heel of her shoes, who assumes he is a contractor of sorts from the pager he was given by Customs but is surprised by his respectful kindness to her.
When Viktor is unable to secure himself some food after Dixon cuts him off from an avenue of money, his plight is noticed by a food service worker at the airport, Enrique Cruz, who offers him food in exchange for helping in learning more about an immigration officer that he is infatuated with, Dolores Torres.
After meeting with Amelia once again and wanting to take her out for a meal, Viktor begins improving his English while attempting to find work, and is soon hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.
During this time, he also befriends some of Enrique's friends whom he plays poker with, including a cargo handler named Joe Mulroy, and an Indian janitor named Gupta Rajan, learning from the latter that he had come to the States in order to avoid being arrested for stabbing a corrupt police officer back in India in 1979.
When a Russian traveler creates a delicate situation when Customs try to remove the medicine he is carrying for his father, Dixon is annoyed when Viktor, whom he uses to persuade the man to leave the medicine behind, claims he misheard his Krakozhian dialect for "father" as "goat" so the traveler can leave with them.
Shortly after the traveler leaves, Dixon strong-arms him over a photocopier, nearly blowing his chance for promotion, before later promising Viktor that he will never let him leave the airport.
When the airport employees hear from Gupta of the incident in customs with the Russian and what Viktor did, Viktor finds himself respected and admired for his kind-hearted actions, with many stores showing off photocopied images of his hand that had been accidentally made.
When Viktor meets with Amelia once again and takes her out for a meal, he slowly begins taking an interest with her, even wooing her, before offering to surprise her with a gift when she returns, based on his recent knowledge of Napoleon, soon creating a majestic fountain.
After helping Enrique finally marry Torres, Viktor awaits the arrival of Amelia.
Unbeknown to him, Dixon pulls her aside to question her about Viktor, revealing his true situation in the process.
Feeling that he lied to her, Amelia confronts Viktor in Gate 67, shocked at his predicament, and tries to learn why he came to New York.
Agreeing to tell her, Viktor reveals the contents of the peanut can he was carrying, explaining that his late father, a jazz enthusiast, had discovered the famous portrait, "A Great Day in Harlem", in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, where after spending a week looking at it, he vowed he would collect the signatures of all 57 of the jazz musicians featured on it.
Viktor reveals that the can contains not only a copy of the portrait, but the autographs of all the musicians his father received, but one - tenor saxophonist Benny Golson.
After his father died, Viktor had promised to collect the last signature by coming to New York to find Golson.
After hearing his story, Amelia kisses Viktor.
After having spent nine months in the terminal, Viktor is awakened by his friends who give him news that the war in Krakozhia has ended.
Overjoyed, he celebrates in an airport bar, where Amelia meets with him and explains that a man she had been having an affair with, a government official, helped her to secure Viktor with a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream.
While delighted, Viktor is saddened when he learns that her "friend" did so in order to renew their relationship.
Despite this, Viktor heads off to Customs with renewed hope of going to New York, only to find that Dixon must sign the visa.
Seizing the opportunity, Dixon instructs Viktor to go home to Krakozhia, threatening to cause trouble for Viktor's friends by deporting them if he refuses.
Unwilling to let that happen, he agrees to do so, despite his friends offering to prevent this happening.
When Gupta, assuming he was acting a coward, learns of the situation he was put into, he decides to take the burden off Viktor by running in front of the plane to Krakozhia as it taxies to the terminal, choosing to let himself be deported back to his home country in order to let his friend go to New York.
Dixon, shocked by this, attempts to stop Viktor leaving as he receives gifts from employees for his trip into the city, but is thwarted by his Custom agents, who allow him to leave.
As Viktor leaves, seeing Amelia once more before taking a taxi, Dixon decides to finally not pursue him further.
Meanwhile, Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing, and finally collects the last autograph.
As he steps into a taxi and places the last signature into the can, he soon tells the driver, "I am going home".

Sixteen Candles

High school sophomore Samantha "Sam" Baker (Molly Ringwald) struggles to get through the day on her 16th birthday, which her entire family has forgotten about because her older sister, Ginny (Blanche Baker), is getting married the next day.
She is also plagued by infatuation with a popular and attractive senior, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling).
At school she fares no better when she finds out that a completed "sex quiz", which she tried to surreptitiously slip to her friend Randy (Liane Curtis), never reached her friend Randy and, unbeknownst to either of them, was picked up by Jake.
Sam panics because the quiz contains sensitive information, such as she is a virgin and is saving herself for Jake.
She has a whole new set of problems when she arrives home to discover all four of her grandparents are staying at the Baker home during the wedding.
One set of grandparents has brought along a bizarre foreign exchange student, Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe).
The grandparents force Sam to take him along to her school's senior dance that night and, to Sam's amazement, it takes "The Donger" only five minutes to find an unlikely girlfriend&mdash;the tall, large-breasted jock, Marlene (Deborah Pollack), nicknamed "Lumberjack".
They are found slow dancing in the gym.
A subplot involves a geeky freshman (Anthony Michael Hall) who tries to win a bet with his friends by continually (and unsuccessfully) trying to bed his love interest, Sam.
The character is referred to on several occasions in the film as either "Ted" or "Farmer Ted", but is credited simply as "the Geek".
On the way home on the school bus, Sam blows him off by saying, "Go to hell".
In the school auto shop during the dance, Sam and Ted begin talking and Sam confesses her love for Jake.
Upon hearing this, Ted tells her that Jake had been asking about her at the dance, and they agree that Sam should just go and talk to him.
As she's leaving, Ted reveals the wager to Sam, who agrees to loan him her panties to help him win.
Later (after a $1 admission peepshow of Sam's panties, which Sam finds out about the next day), Ted and his equally unwelcome geeky friends, Cliff (Darren Harris) and Bryce (John Cusack), go to the senior dance after-party, hosted at Jake's house.
When they knock on the door, Long Duk Dong, who has come to the party with Marlene, greets them.
Ted and his gang get in but they make a big mistake by knocking over the jocks' beer can pyramid.
Ted and Bryce leave it up to Cliff to deal with the jocks.
Meanwhile, upstairs in Jake's bedroom, Jake takes the opportunity to look through the yearbook and finds Sam's photo.
He jots down her phone-number on a scrap of paper and calls her, only to be disappointed when her grandparents pick up the phone.
Jake's entire house is completely trashed.
At night's end, Jake finds Ted trapped under a table and they begin to talk.
Jake inquires further about Sam, and Ted explains the situation.
Jake makes a deal with Ted: If Ted lets Jake keep Sam's panties, Jake will allow Ted to drive home his drunk popular girlfriend, Caroline Mulford (Haviland Morris), in Jake's father's Rolls Royce.
Jake later uses the excuse of finding them together to break up with Caroline (who had surprisingly fallen for Ted and doesn't mind the break-up very much).
Ted's friends filmed Ted and Caroline making out.
Afterward, Jake drives to the church just in time to meet an incredulous Sam after her sister's wedding.
The film concludes with Sam and Jake sharing a kiss over a birthday cake with 16 candles.

Meet the Parents

Gaylord "Greg" Focker (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse living in Chicago, who intends to propose to his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), a schoolteacher.
His plan is disrupted when Pam's younger sister, Debbie, becomes engaged and he finds out that Debbie's fiance, dr Robert "Bob" Banks had asked Pam's father for permission before proposing.
Greg and Pam travel to Pam's parents' house in Oyster Bay, Long Island to attend the wedding.
Greg hopes to propose to Pam in front of her family after receiving her father's permission, but this plan is put on hold when the airline loses his luggage, including the engagement ring.
When they arrive at the Byrnes' home, Greg meets Pam's father Jack (Robert De Niro), her mother Dina (Blythe Danner) and their beloved cat, Jinx (also named mr Jinx or Jinxy), a brown and black Himalayan cat.
Jack takes an instant dislike to Greg and openly criticizes him for his chosen career of nursing and whatever else he sees as a sign of weakness.
Greg's attempts to impress Jack either go unnoticed or backfire: He inadvertently leads Jack to think he does drugs, while mentioning the possible subtle drug references in "Puff, the Magic Dragon" while listening to the song on the car stereo on the way to the drug store, and Jack later finds a marijuana pipe that he believes belongs to Greg (it actually belongs to Pam's younger brother, Denny).
At dinner, Greg, who is Jewish, recites the lyrics from the song "Day by Day" from the musical "Godspell" when asked to say Grace, and makes up a story about milking a cat in an attempt to explain to Jack why he had earlier caught Greg reading a pharmacy magazine about lactation.
Greg presents the Byrnes family with a bottle of Mumm's champagne he bought from the drug store, but as soon as Jack reveals that Pam had a previous fiancé, the cork suddenly pops off by itself and accidentally smashes an urn which holds the remains of Jack's mother, giving Jinx the opportunity to urinate in the ashes.
Greg becomes even more uncomfortable after receiving an impromptu lie detector test from Jack, and Pam later reveals that Jack is actually a recently retired CIA counterintelligence officer.
Meeting the rest of Pam's family and friends, including Debbie, her fiance, his parents, and Pam's highly successful, both financially and spiritually, ex-fiancee Kevin (Owen Wilson), Greg still feels like an outsider.
Things between Greg and Jack go from bad to worse during a game of water volleyball, where Jack becomes irritated with Greg's incompetent playing, and in an attempt to play more seriously, Greg accidentally hits Debbie while spiking the ball, giving her a bloody nose and a black eye; and when Greg later uses a malfunctioning toilet (and claims that Jinx used it, which Jack does not accept), the Byrnes' yard is flooded with sewage.
The airline arrives with the luggage that Greg lost, but it turns out to not be his, and while Greg is on the phone attempting to solve the issue, he accidentally causes Jinx to get loose.
While chasing Jinx, Greg accidentally starts a fire in the yard, destroying a wedding altar that Kevin had sculpted for Debbie's wedding.
Jack himself conducts a background check on Greg's MCAT scores and finds nothing on anyone named Greg Focker ever taking the MCAT's.
Jack then inspects what he thinks is Greg's luggage, unaware that it is actually not his own, finding an assortment of sex toys, including a strap-on dildo.
Jack then jumps to the false conclusion that Greg is not even a real nurse, but a drug dealer posing as a hospital worker for easy access to drugs, per their previous discussion about "Puff the Magic Dragon".
Later, the Byrnes family realizes Jinx is missing and Greg, in a last-ditch effort to win Jack over, goes to an animal shelter, finds a feral cat who looks almost exactly like Jinx, except for a white tip on the tail (whereas Jinx has an all-black tail), puts Jinx's collar on him and spray-paints his tail to make the cat look just like Jinx.
While the entire family is out to dinner, Jack gets a voicemail that the real Jinx is at their neighbor's house.
Greg overhears this, and desperately tries to beat Jack home to erase the evidence, but ultimately fails after Jack takes a shortcut.
The family returns home to find the stray cat has completely trashed the living room.
Jack angrily calls Greg out in front of the entire family for his lack of honesty, and demands that he call off his relationship with Pam and leave immediately.
By now, the entire Byrnes family, including Pam, agree with Jack that Greg needs to leave.
Desperate to save himself, Greg reveals that he has witnessed Jack speaking with strange characters (including speaking with someone in Thai over the phone and meeting with a man in a drug store parking lot) and is planning a secret mission to Thailand after Pam's sister's wedding, thus lying about being retired from the CIA.
However, Greg realizes that the hole he dug himself into just got much deeper as Jack angrily explains that the "mission" he was planning was actually a surprise honeymoon to Ko Samui for the newlywed couple and that the man he was meeting with in the parking lot was a travel agent giving him their visas.
As a result, Greg breaks up with Pam, and Greg starts to leave.
Just as Greg is leaving, an airport employee arrives with Greg's real missing luggage, under the name "Gaylord Focker" much to the amusement of the Byrneses.
Greg goes to the airport but, devastated by his break-up with Pam and still upset about the luggage mix-up, gets so angry that he eventually finds himself detained by airport security for causing a scene on the plane while frustratingly trying to get his luggage into the overhead storage hold and for saying the word "bomb".
Back at the Byrnes' household, Jack still believes that Greg would be an unsuitable husband, as he is completely dishonest and incompetent.
Upon receiving retribution from his wife, who claims that Jack never warmed up to Kevin until after he and Pam broke up, and Pam (as well as confirmation that Greg actually aced the MCAT's), Jack realizes that Pam truly loves Greg.
Jack rushes to the airport, convinces airport security to release Greg, and demands that he be honest about everything that transpired.
Greg admits that he loves Pam, and everything he did before was out of desperation to win Jack's approval.
Jack admits that maybe he had been too hard on Greg, and he brings him back to the Byrnes' household.
Greg proposes to Pam.
She accepts, and her parents agree that they should now meet Greg's parents.
After Debbie's wedding, Jack views footage of Greg recorded by hidden cameras that he had placed strategically around their house.

My Stepmother Is an Alien

Celeste (Kim Basinger) is an alien sent on a secret mission to Earth and Steven Mills (Dan Aykroyd) is a widowed scientist who is working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space.
An accident causes a disruption of gravity on Celeste's home world (Cosine N to the 8th).
She is sent to investigate who could affect gravity and how it was done, believing it was an attack.
She is aided by an alien device resembling a tentacle with an eye, which hides in a designer purse to aid Celeste with her encounters on Earth.
The bag is able to create any object, such as diamonds and designer dresses almost instantaneously.
Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven's brother Ron (Jon Lovitz), where she immediately draws attention to herself by making dated references to old TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that it was current (her superiors had just collected the information, which had taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world).
Celeste's inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien when she struggles with simple tasks like trying to kiss for the first time or cooking.
Jessie Mills (Alyson Hannigan), Steven's 13-year-old daughter, notices Celeste's strange habits, like eating car batteries and pulling hard boiled eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands, and becomes suspicious of her.
However, she cannot convince her smitten father that something is unusual about Celeste.
Ron also has his doubts about Celeste, but more on the basis that he feels his brother is doing too much too soon by asking to marry Celeste only a few days after they first met.
Ron tries to dissuade Steven from marrying Celeste on the idea she is an illegal immigrant or planning economic espionage, but then admits he is jealous his brother found his dream girl whereas he will never find a girl like Princess Stéphanie of Monaco.
Celeste encounters new experiences such as sneezing, sexual intercourse, and love.
When finally confronted about being an extraterrestrial by Jessie, Celeste admits her home world is without emotion.
Celeste plans to depart once she discovers the truth, but is put in a quandary by Jessie, who says it will devastate her father, for whom Celeste has now developed feelings.
After Jessie argues with her dad, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car, but is saved by Celeste's powers.
This reveals to Steven that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him and accepted Jessie as her own daughter.
When the leaders of Celeste's home world report in, they ask her to destroy the planet Earth until Steven and she manage to convince them it was not an act of aggression, but an accident.
They accept the explanation on the basis that gravity is returning to normal on their planet and give their blessing for Celeste to be with Steven.
Initially, however, they demand that Celeste return to explain human culture to them, but settle for a native of Earth to serve as ambassador to their world as a token of goodwill.
The ambassadorship is accepted by Ron, who departs for Celeste's world in a spaceship served by several flight attendants, all of whom look like Princess Stéphanie.

There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews), steps down as Queen.
During Mia's 21st birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband.
She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas (Chris Pine).
During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by a Member of Parliament, Viscount Mabrey (John Rhys-Davies) who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown.
While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in.
Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne.
Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month.
Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace, while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is Nicholas.
Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz (Heather Matarazzo) surprises her by visiting.
Together, they pick through potential husbands.
Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby (Callum Blue), Duke of Kenilworth and days later they are engaged.
Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement.
For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle but does not know how.
Queen Clarisse provides an ancestral wooden leg decoy to make it look like she's riding sidesaddle.
Mabrey spooks Mia's horse with a rubber snake and Joe rushes to Mia's aide, but accidentally tears off the wooden leg.
Humiliated, Mia flees to the stables, where Nicholas fails to comfort her.
At a garden party, Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia's relationship with Andrew; Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting she doesn't love him.
Angered, she argues but instead gets bombarded by a kiss.
At first, she kisses him back but then backs away.
Nicholas pursues her even more, which causes both of them to fall into a fountain.
Queen Clarisse finally tells Mia that her behavior with Nicholas needs to stop.
During the Genovian Independence Day parade, Mia sees some boys picking on a little girl (Abigail Breslin), and abruptly halts the parade to comfort the girl.
Learning the children are orphans, Mia has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them walk with her in the parade.
Everyone is impressed by her act of generosity, while Mabrey sees it as a political maneuver.
Mia later decides to convert one of the royal palaces into a temporary children's center.
That night, Mia has her bachelorette/sleepover party, where Queen Clarisse surfs on a mattress and sings a duet with Princess Asana (Raven-Symoné), one of Mia's good friends.
In the meantime, Mabrey realizes Nicholas has fallen for Mia, but Nicholas says that Mia will never love him.
Nicholas comes upon Mia as she is practicing her archery as part of her coronation rites.
He helps her succeed in getting the arrow to hit the bullseye, something she had been struggling with.
Nicholas then informs Mia that he is leaving, but asks to see her just one more time before he goes.
She declines, saying she is under close guard.
That night, Nicholas appears outside Mia's window and asks her to come out.
Lilly encourages her to go, and Mia sneaks out.
They ride out to a lake where they share secrets, dance and eventually fall asleep.
They awaken to find a man in a boat videotaping them.
Mia thinks Nicholas set her up, while he insists he had no idea.
By the time Mia gets back to the palace, the scandalous footage is already being broadcast.
Andrew is disappointed and kisses Mia to see if there is a romantic spark between them.
They realize they do not love each other, but do not call off the wedding for the good of Genovia.
The wedding is to take place the following day, and Mia's mother Helen (Caroline Goodall) comes with her new husband Patrick (Sean O'Bryan) and their newborn son Trevor.
Nicholas decides against attending, but his surly housekeeper Gretchen informs him that Mabrey engineered their televised scandal.
Right before the wedding, Joe informs Mia that Nicholas is innocent.
Queen Clarisse encourages Mia to follow her heart, something she has never done and has now cost her Joe, the only man she truly loved.
Mia reenters the church, and after pointing out how her grandmother has ruled Genovia while unmarried for a number of years, she tells the members of parliament in the audience to consider the significant women in their lives (such as their wives, sisters, daughters and nieces) and questions if they would have them do what they're trying to force her to do (marrying people they don't love).
Mabrey cites the law again and once again suggests that his nephew be named King, but just then, Nicholas not only refuses the crown, but also disowns Mabrey as his uncle.
Mia proposes the law on royal marriages be abolished, and the Parliament unanimously gives its assent.
Encouraged by Mia to have her own happy ending, Clarisse proposes to Joe and they are promptly married.
About a week later, Mia is preparing for her coronation when Nicholas shows up.
He professes his love for Mia on bended knees, and they share a romantic kiss.
The next day, Mia is crowned "Her Majesty Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi, Queen of Genovia", with all in attendance in the royal palace.
An epilogue shows that Genovian Parliament now allows female members, one of whom is Charlotte.
And Queen Mia officially opens the children's home.

Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London

Agent Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) attends summer camp, actually a secret facility for training CIA teenage agents.
When a group of CIA soldiers attempt to abduct head counselor Victor Diaz (Keith Allen), Cody helps him escape, mistaking the CIA operation for a training exercise.
The director informs Cody that Diaz stole disks containing plans for a secret mind-control device, and sends Cody to recapture him.
In the United Kingdom, Cody poses as a summer orchestra student at the Kenworth estate to spy on owner Lord Duncan Kenworth, suspected of working with Diaz, supported by his handler, Derek (Anthony Anderson) and Kumar, Derek's right-hand man, who are disguised as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth and a taxi driver respectively.
Whilst keeping his mission a secret from his fellow students, Cody sneaks around the estate and confirms that Diaz and Duncan are working together and that they have a working prototype of the mind control device, evidenced when Duncan makes a dog serve drinks and play the piano.
The next day, Cody breaks into a lab owned by Duncan, where he sees the finished device: a microchip inserted as a filling into a tooth cavity by dentist Santiago.
Shortly afterwards Cody and Derek chase Diaz, armed with a rocket gun, through London streets, but Cody is captured by the Metropolitan Police Service and taken to Scotland Yard.
He is later freed by Emily (Hannah Spearritt), a fellow student who, similar to Cody, is actually a British MI6 undercover operative.
While Emily buys coffee and soda, henchmen sneak up on Cody, knocking him unconscious by drugging him with spray.
They kidnap him and implant him with the microchip.
Under Duncan, Santiago and Diaz's influence, Cody meets the CIA director, who is then also converted.
This is witnessed by Emily, who explains things to Derek.
To get the microchip out of Cody, Derek cuts one of Cody's gadgets, exploding Mentos mints, into a precisely minuscule amount to safely remove it.
The group later realise Diaz's plan: to implant all of the world leaders, who are all in London for a G7 summit at Buckingham Palace, effectively giving him control of the world.
Deducing that with the CIA director under Diaz's control, they may be put on a most wanted list, Cody, Derek and Emily infiltrate the party before the summit.
There, they realize that most of the dignitaries have already been implanted due to bizarre behavior and Duncan being appointed director of the Royal Mint by the British Prime Minister (upon accepting this, Duncan cruelly states to Josephine that he is leaving her).
They explain the truth to the other students, who are performing for the guests, and urge them to keep the world leaders from attending the G7 summit.
They later proceed to do so with an impromptu but rousing performance of War, accompanied by dancing and clapping from the assembled dignitaries and Queen Elizabeth herself, whilst Cody, Emily and Derek search for the villains.
Derek is implanted with the microchip, and is set on Cody by Santiago.
Before Santiago can kill him through Derek, Emily finds and subdues him, disabling the mind control software and rescuing theS.
President, who was to be implanted.
Shortly after Cody kicks out Derek's microchip, the two of them remove the CIA director's microchip.
Diaz, realising that his plan has failed attempts to flee, but ends up fighting, and being defeated by Cody in the Queen's gift room, destroying numerous priceless artifacts in the process.
Duncan also attempts to escape, but is tripped by his apparently senile and blind butler, who turns out to be Emily's handler and is arrested, much to Lady Kenworth's delight.
After the villains are arrested, Cody returns to the camp, where Derek is now in charge as reward.
Cody's parents pick him up, none the wiser about his dangerous exploits.
Alex, Cody's younger brother tries to eat a few of his explosive Mentos, but Cody tosses them into the pond where they explode harmlessly.

The Seven Year Itch

Richard Sherman (Tom Ewell) is a nerdy, faithful, middle-aged publishing executive with an overactive imagination and a mid-life crisis, whose wife, Helen (Evelyn Keyes), and son, Ricky (Butch Bernard), are spending the summer in Maine.
When he returns home with the kayak paddle Ricky accidentally left behind, he meets a woman (Marilyn Monroe), who is a commercial actress and former model who rents the apartment upstairs while in town to make television spots for a brand of toothpaste.
That evening, he works on reading the manuscript of a book in which psychiatrist dr Brubaker (Oskar Homolka) claims that almost all men are driven to have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage.
Sherman has an imaginary conversation with Helen, trying to convince her, in three fantasy sequences, that he is irresistible to women, including his secretary, a nurse, and Helen's bridesmaid, but she laughs it off.
A tomato plant then crashes into his lounge chair; the woman upstairs apologizes for accidentally knocking it off the balcony, and Richard invites her down for a drink.
He waits for her to get dressed, including in underwear she says she keeps cool in her icebox.
When she arrives, a vision in pink, they have a drink and he lies about being married.
When she sees his wedding ring, he backtracks but she is unconcerned, having no designs on him, only on his air-conditioning.
He has a fantasy that she is a femme fatale overcome by his playing of Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto.
In reality, she prefers Chopsticks, which they play together.
Richard, overcome by his fantasies, awkwardly grabs at her, causing them to fall off the piano bench.
He apologizes for his indiscretion but she says it happens to her all the time.
Guilt-ridden, however, he asks her to leave.
Over the next few days, they spend more time together and Richard imagines that they are growing closer, although she is immune to his imagined charms.

Eventually coming to his senses, and fearing his wife's retribution, which he imagines in a fantasy scene, Richard, paddle in hand, tells the young woman she can stay in his apartment; then he runs off to catch the next train to Maine to be with Helen and Ricky.

But I'm a Cheerleader

Seventeen-year-old Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a sunny high school senior who loves cheerleading and is dating football player Jared (Brandt Wille).

Combined with Megan's interest in vegetarianism and Melissa Etheridge, her family and friends suspect that Megan is in fact a lesbian.
With the help of ex-gay Mike (RuPaul), they surprise her with an intervention.
Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp which uses a five-step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program) to convert its campers to heterosexuality.
At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, strict disciplinarian Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), Mary's supposedly heterosexual son Rock (Eddie Cibrian), and a group of young people trying to "cure" themselves of their homosexuality.
With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan reluctantly agrees that she is a lesbian (step 1 of the five-step program).
This fact, at odds with her traditional, religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming heterosexual.
Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton (Dante Basco and Kip Pardue), making out.
She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike.
Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.
The True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality (step 1), rediscovering their gender identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding the root of their homosexuality through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5).
Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, a college student named Graham (Clea DuVall) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.
The True Directions kids are encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance.
When Mary discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse.
Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love.
When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant.
She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd.
Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp.
Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton.
Megan and Dolph infiltrate the True Directions graduation ceremony where Dolph easily coaxes Clayton away.
Megan entreats Graham to join them as well, but Graham nervously declines.
Megan then performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her, finally winning Graham over.
They drive off with Dolph and Clayton.
The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents (Mink Stole and Bud Cort) attending a PFLAG meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.

King Ralph

The entire ruling family of the United Kingdom is electrocuted in a freak accident while posing for a family photograph.
Sir Cedric Willingham (Peter O'Toole) leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown.
A researcher finally locates a living heir named Ralph Jones (John Goodman), an American.
In Las Vegas, Ralph, an easygoing slob, works as a lounge singer/piano player in a casino.
Ralph is informed that he is now king; his grandfather, the first Duke of Warren, engaged in an affair with a hotel maid while visiting the States.
Since his father and grandfather have died, Ralph is the only surviving heir.
Ralph is flown to London, where he meets Willingham and begins a long period of instruction intended to turn him into a proper monarch.
He is schooled in English history and culture and shown a variety of English dishes.
Shortly after his arrival, Ralph goes to a strip club, meeting the exotic dancer Miranda Greene (Camille Coduri).
When she is unable to perform topless, Ralph meets her backstage.
She is skeptical of his claim to be king, but Ralph proposes that if he can prove he is, Miranda will go on a date with him, and his appearance on the news proves his claim.
Lord Percival Graves (John Hurt), Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale (James Villiers), and Willingham meet to discuss Ralph's selection as King.
Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne, and proposes to declare the ruling family line at an end and replace it with the serene House of Stuart.
As Graves is the patriarch of the Stuarts, he would thus become King.
Hale states that Ralph has royal blood, and that the country will have to accept him unless Ralph commits a grievous error.
Graves decides to use Miranda to embarrass Ralph and remove him from the throne.
Offered money to maneuver Ralph into a compromising position, Miranda accepts.
She and Ralph begin falling in love.
Miranda returns the money to Graves, but Graves already has pictures of them.
To protect Ralph, Miranda severs the relationship.
Despite Ralph's reluctance to accept British culture and his ineptness in formal affairs, he makes a positive impression on King Mulambon (Rudolph Walker) of Zambezi during the latter's state visit.
The two monarchs share their concerns about the role of leadership they have assumed and the economic interests of their nations.
Ralph accumulates a small but loyal following.
Ralph's staff arrange for him to marry Princess Anna (Joely Richardson) of Finland; Ralph receives her and her parents on a state visit.
Graves has photos of Miranda and Ralph passed around at the royal ball, which, along with Ralph's wild rendition of "Good Golly Miss Molly" on a harpsichord, ruin any chances of a Royal marriage and causes a Finnish company to award a coveted contract to the Japanese.
Having failed to realize that the role of King comes with formal expectations, and that he cannot rely on his charm or blue-collar background, Ralph accepts a stern rebuke from Sir Cedric Willingham and endeavors to set things right.
Miranda confesses to Ralph her role in the scandal.
Ralph develops suspicions about his circumstances, and learns that Willingham is another heir to the throne and had refused the role.
Ralph addresses Parliament.
He apologizes for his recent actions and informs Parliament that he has worked out a deal with the King of Zambezi that will create British jobs.
He then reveals that Graves has been sabotaging his succession to the throne and has him arrested for violating the Treason Act of 1702.
Finally, he tells the British people that he believes they deserve a better monarch.
Ralph abdicates his throne, revealing that Willingham will succeed him.
Willingham becomes King Cedric I and decide to fulfil Ralph's legacy as a great king from him, and Ralph pursues his relationship with Miranda, along with his dreams of being a rock star.

A Thin Line Between Love and Hate

Nightclub manager Darnell Wright is a perpetual playboy and hopeless male chauvinist.
He works for a nightclub called Chocolate City and aspires to be its owner.
He trades VIP privileges at the club for favors from women.
Though he is an expert at conning women, he sometimes worries about what his childhood sweetheart Mia (Regina King) thinks of his adventures.
When the classy and elegant Brandi (Lynn Whitfield) steps out of a limousine to enter the club, Darnell feels that he's met his ultimate prize.
She rejects his come-ons, which only fuels his appetite.
He pursues her, showing up with flowers at her real estate office.
He finally wins over Brandi, only to find out that he's really in love with Mia.
But Brandi doesn't take kindly to rejection.
It appears that she has borderline personality disorder and becomes an obsessed femme fatale stalking him, even taking all four wheels off his SUV to ground him from his rounds and demolishing his nightclub.
Ending his relationship with Mia is not enough to satisfy Brandi who finally administers Darnell's punishment for his misogyny.
Darnell quickly learns the hard way that when you "play", you have to "pay".
The film ends much like the last verse of the song "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate", with an injured Darnell in the hospital pondering over what happened to him and deciding to change, and a mugshot of Brandi and Darnell's voice saying "Damn I'm truly sorry about what happened to Brandi.
I hope baby lands on her feet, but they better make damn sure they fix that dent in her heart before they let her out".

Now Helen is very successful in the fashion industry, working as the executive assistant to the CEO of one of Manhattan's most prestigious modeling agencies, and now has a nice Manhattan lifestyle which keeps her extremely occupied and content.
But Helen's world suddenly changes when Lindsay and brother-in-law Paul (Sean O'Bryan) die in a car accident, leaving behind three children, turning everyone's life upside down.
Helen and Jenny are in shock when they hear Lindsay and Paul left Helen in charge of their three kids: 15-year-old Audrey (Hayden Panettiere), 10-year-old Henry (Spencer Breslin), and five-year-old Sarah (Abigail Breslin).
Nobody expected Helen to be named guardian of the children especially since Jenny was already a super mom with two children and a third on the way.
But a letter left to Helen by Lindsay convinces her that she can take care of the children.
And Helen decides to do it on her own terms, which means raising the children and maintaining her already fast-paced schedule.
But as work and children begin to interfere, Helen quickly finds herself burnt out and disheartened by her responsibilities and Jenny's lack of faith in her parenting.
Despite her already hectic schedule, Helen finds the time to develop a genuine affection for her new dependents, as well as an equally genuine attraction to Dan Parker (John Corbett), the kids' school principal and local Lutheran pastor.
Busy trying to appease the children and adjust to suddenly being a mom, Helen's concentration on her job begins to slip and she is fired from Dominique (Helen Mirren).
Stuck between a rock and a hard place, she is forced to become a receptionist at a car dealership.
Things begin to look better for her as she bonds with the children and their sexy principal, and finally begins to get the hang of being a mom.

When she disappears from the school prom with her new boyfriend BZ to go find a motel, Helen is forced to call in Jenny as back-up to search all over New York to find Audrey.
Unable to confront Audrey and risk the girl's hatred, once they track her down, Helen turns the parenting reins over to Jenny.
This makes Helen realize that she isn't cut out to be a parent and so she turns the children over into Jenny's custody.
Helen returns to her wild lifestyle full of partying and booze, but feels much less fulfilled than she had been before she became responsible for the children.
She begins to find herself dissatisfied and depressed and so returns to Jenny's house to beg her to let her take the children back home.
She eventually convinces Jenny that she's finally ready to be a parent when she puts her foot down and shows Audrey who's boss.
Jenny, who was listening to Helen talking to the children, still refuses to give the kids back to her.
Helen leaves, and sits alone on a bench near a swing set.
There, she is visited once again by Jenny, who gives her the letter that Lindsay had written for Jenny.
Helen reads the letter, which explains that Lindsay decided to choose Helen because it's about choosing someone who is more like herself, someone who can really give the children the mother they really want.
While watching out her window, Helen turns around with joy when the kids arrive, now hers.
The film ends with Helen, Dan and the kids walking along a pier, and Sarah sits on a bench and ties her shoes all by herself.

Laws of Attraction

High-powered divorce attorneys Audrey Woods (Julianne Moore) and Daniel Rafferty (Pierce Brosnan) have seen love go wrong in many scenarios—so, how good could their own chances be.
As two of the top divorce lawyers in New York, Audrey and Daniel are a study in opposites.
She practises law strictly by the book; he seems to win by the seat of his pants, or by "cheap theatrics," as Audrey says in one scene.
Soon the two lawyers are pitted against one other in several high-profile divorce cases, including a nasty public split between rock star Thorne Jamison (Michael Sheen) and his dress-designer wife, Serena (Parker Posey).
The settlement hinges on an Irish castle, Caisleán Cloiche, or "Rock Castle," that each spouse wants.
Audrey and Daniel travel to Ireland to chase down depositions, and both stay in the castle; although Audrey, at least, is reluctant to acknowledge their mutual attraction, they find themselves attending a romantic Irish festival together.
After a night of wild celebration, they wake up the next morning to discover they have wed.
Audrey is shocked, though Daniel takes their apparent marriage in his stride.
The pair return to New York and find news of their wedding printed on Page 6 of the New York Post the following day.
Audrey suggests that the two maintain the semblance of a marriage for the sake of their careers, and Daniel moves into the guest room of Audrey’s apartment.
Although in the courtroom they continue to fight the Jamisons’ high-profile divorce case with the gusto they have always shown, at home they settle into domestic life together.
While disposing of garbage one day, Daniel accidentally discovers some sensitive information about Audrey's client, Thorne Jamison, which he reveals in the next day's court proceedings.
Audrey feels betrayed and asks for a divorce, which Daniel agrees to give, citing his love for her.
Next, their famous clients each return to the castle in Ireland, even though they are not permitted to be there pending division of assets.
Judge Abramovitz (Nora Dunn) sends their respective counsellors to Ireland to inform them of this, but on arrival they discover that the celebrity couple has reunited on the anniversary of their wedding.
Audrey and Daniel then learn that the “priest" who performed their own marriage ceremony is in fact the Jamisons' butler, and the “weddings" he presided over at the festival were simply romantic celebrations.

Confronting him in the grocery store below Daniel’s Chinatown office, Audrey asks Daniel if he is willing to fight to save their relationship.

Scrooged

Frank Cross is an inconsiderate and arrogant executive in the IBC television network headquarters.
He is preparing an extravagant live production of A Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve, forcing the network's staff, including his assistant Grace Cooley, to work on the holiday.
He also fires the meek Eliot Loudermilk for disagreeing with him, denies his employees their Christmas bonus, and gives everyone on his Christmas list, including Grace and his brother James, a monogrammed towel.
Meanwhile, Frank's boss Preston Rhinelander has hired Brice Cummings, who is transparently after Frank's job.
Hours before the show starts, Frank is visited by the ghost of his mentor Lew Hayward, who announces that three ghosts will appear over the course of the night.
Lew also causes Frank's phone to call Claire Phillips, Frank's true love from years ago.
Claire comes to visit Frank, but he is too busy to talk to her.
She leaves him the address of the homeless shelter where she works.
The Ghost of Christmas Past appears as a taxi driver who takes Frank back to his childhood, beginning in 1955.
His father Earl is an unloving meatpacking foreman who gives him veal for Christmas and yells at him when he objects.
Frank's only solace is in the world of television, foreshadowing his eventual career path.
The Ghost then takes Frank forward to 1968-71 to see himself as a young man meeting Claire, and showing how Frank's rise to power changed his emotional life, and that Frank is to blame for the loss of Claire.
Returned to the present, Frank goes to the homeless shelter to apologize to Claire and invites her to lunch to mend fences.
However, when shelter workers pester Claire, Frank reverts to his old self, and bluntly tells Claire she is letting life pass her by, and to only care about herself.
Back at IBC, Frank watches final preparations before the live show.
The Ghost of Christmas Present appears as a cute, yet volatile pixie who goes by the motto, "Sometimes you have to slap people in the face to get their attention".
She shows Frank how Grace struggles with the long hours he puts her through, without being able to care for her family.
Her son Calvin has been mute since the death of his father five years prior.
The Ghost also shows him how James is enjoying Christmas with his wife and friends; James still invites Frank every year, although he never attends.
Frank begins to show empathy.
The Ghost leaves Frank in a utility space under a sidewalk, where he finds the frozen body of Herman, a homeless man he had met earlier at Claire's shelter; Frank had refused to buy him a cup of coffee.
Frank struggles to escape through a boarded-up door, but when he forces the door he crashes through the IBC set during the final rehearsal.
Preston has put Brice in charge, fearing that Frank is having a mental breakdown.
Frank returns to his office where he is repeatedly shot at by a furious Eliot, whose life he has ruined.
Frank dives into an elevator, and finds the Ghost of Christmas Future, appearing as a towering cloaked skeleton with tortured souls trapped inside his ribcage and a TV for a head, waiting for him.
This Ghost shows him that if Frank continues on this path, Claire will become cold-hearted and Calvin will be committed to a mental institution.
Frank then sees himself in a casket at a funeral only attended by James and his wife, Wendie.
However, just as the casket is cremated, Frank is returned to reality.
Horrified and humbled by what he's been shown, Frank returns a changed man.
He rehires Eliot on the spot, and they take over the live show by holding Brice and the control box at gunpoint.
Frank goes on-camera, improvising a speech that denounces his own decision to run a live show on Christmas Eve instead of taping it, and explains what he has learned over the last few hours.
He apologizes on-air to James and to Claire.
Claire rushes to IBC, given a lift by the Past Ghost.
As Frank encourages the cast and crew to sing, Calvin speaks for the first time in five years, reminding Frank of the final lines of the show "God bless us, everyone".
As Claire and Grace join him, Frank tells everyone to join him in singing "Put a Little Love in Your Heart", while Lew and the other Ghosts, including Herman, look on, happy and impressed.

Empire Records

Empire Records is an independent record shop managed by Joe (Anthony LaPaglia).
The store is located in a fictional city in Delaware, and, like its employees, is eclectic and unique.
The staff is very much a surrogate family, with Joe as the reluctant and perpetually exasperated but lovable father figure.
When his young staff experience problems in their personal lives, he routinely reminds them they can seek him out for advice.
The film opens with store manager Joe allowing employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) his first opportunity to close the store, an opportunity Lucas regards as an honor.
While counting the day's receipts in Joe's office, Lucas snoops and discovers that Empire Records is about to be bought and converted into a branch of Music Town, a large national music store with many franchises.
In an effort to keep the store independent, Lucas takes the day's cash receipts totaling $9,000 to a casino in Atlantic City in an attempt to quadruple it via gambling.
Lucas believes this act will create enough money to allow Joe to save Empire Records.
Though initially doubling the money, Lucas soon loses the entire amount in one bet on a dice table.
Instead of going home he sleeps on his motorcycle outside the store, where he is found the following morning by opening managerJ.
(Johnny Whitworth) and fellow employee Mark (Ethan Embry).
He confides in the pair about the previous night's events before riding away, seemingly for good.
Joe arrives to help open the store and quickly receives phone calls from both the bank and the store owner, Mitchell Beck (Ben Bodé), regarding the previous night's missing deposit.
Joe is distracted from immediately dealing with this crisis due to a scheduled store event: Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield), a former 80's pop idol, is due to arrive at the store for an autograph session to promote his new album.
The staff is unenthused by "Rex Manning Day", and ultimately many of the fans showing up to meet him are either older women or gay men.
The employees secretly tease Rex behind his back about his fading career, and even his assistant Jane (Debi Mazar) later reveals her distaste for Rex's music.
Lucas returns after the store opens and Joe confronts him about the missing deposit.
After telling him of his short misadventure, Lucas is asked to stay in the store until a plan is devised to recoup the lost $9,000.
Joe explains that he had intended to use the money to invest and become part-owner of the store, which would allow him the opportunity of saving it from becoming a Music Town franchise.
Next to arrive are cashiers Corey (Liv Tyler), an overachieving high school student, and her uninhibited best friend and co-worker Gina (Renée Zellweger), both of whom are informed of the situation.
Soon thereafter arrives hostile employee Deb (Robin Tunney), who is in a particularly bad state of mind; she has survived an apparent suicide attempt and immediately shaves her head in the bathroom upon arriving at work.
Deb's boyfriend Berko (Coyote Shivers) soon arrives as well.
The afternoon continues in a downward spiral.
A young belligerent shoplifter who identifies himself only as "Warren Beatty" (Brendan Sexton III) is apprehended by Lucas and subsequently arrested, promising to return for revenge.
Encouraged by Gina, Corey's school-girl crush on Rex is pushed to its limits—much to the horror of her friends, includingJ, who is infatuated with her.
This leads to the revelation that Corey is secretly using Amphetamines.
After arguing with Corey, Gina has sex with Rex Manning, causing the rift between the two friends to intensify and Rex to get kicked out of the store by Joe.
Deb takes Corey aside and advises her on the questionable choices she is making, choices which may have dire consequences on her bright future.
In return, Corey holds a mock funeral for Deb and the whole store attends.
Gina then apologizes to Corey.
The pugnacious "Warren Beatty" keeps his word and returns to the store with a gun (loaded with blanks) to seek revenge.
Lucas reveals that he was once a troubled youth much like "Warren" until he was taken in by Joe, who gave him a home and a job and helped him turn his life around.
The staff surmises that "Warren" just needs a similar chance.
Joe subsequently offers him a job at the store.
After the police leave, Lucas admits defeat, and suggests calling Mitchell.
However, the employees, Joe, and Jane — who has since quit working for Rex — pool their resources to replace the missing money.
Despite their best efforts, they are thousands short.
Suddenly inspired, Mark runs out of the store, jumps in front of a news crew covering the holdup, and announces a late night benefit party to "Save the Empire".
The store opens its doors and collects donations while selling food, drinks, and merchandise to raise the remaining money.
They manage to raise just enough, which they offer to store owner Mitchell.
Mitchell in turn offers to sell the store to Joe, admitting that Joe has always loved the place while he himself has always hated it.
Joe agrees to become the new owner.
Corey meets up with a dejectedJ on the roof and confesses that she does love him.
He tells her he has decided to attend art school in Boston so he can be near her when she goes to Harvard.
They then kiss.
In celebration of maintaining Empire Records' independence and their victory against "the man", the staff ends the long and eventful day with a dance party on the store's roof.

Bulworth

In March 1996, DemocraticS.
Senator Jay Bulworth of California is losing his bid for re-election to a fiery young populist.
Bulworth's socialist views, formed in the 1960s and 1970s, have lost favor with voters, so he has conceded to more conservative politics and to accepting donations from big corporations.
In addition, though he and his wife have been having affairs with each other's knowledge for years, they must still present a happy façade in the interest of maintaining a good public image.
Tired of politics, unhappy with his life in general, and planning to commit suicide, Bulworth negotiates a $10 million life insurance policy with his daughter as the beneficiary in exchange for a favorable vote from the insurance industry.
Knowing that a suicide will void his daughter's inheritance, he contracts to have himself assassinated within two days.
Turning up in California for his campaign extremely drunk, Bulworth freely begins speaking his mind at public events and in the presence of the C-SPAN film crew following his campaign.
After dancing all night in an underground club and smoking marijuana, he even starts rapping in public.
His frank, potentially offensive remarks make him an instant media darling and re-energize his campaign.
Along the way he becomes romantically involved with a young black activist named Nina, who tags along with him on his campaign stops.
He is pursued by the paparazzi, his insurance company, his campaign managers and an increasingly adoring public, all the while fearful of his impending assassination.
After a televised debate during which Bulworth drinks from a flask on air and derides insurance companies and the American healthcare system, he decides to hide at Nina's family's home, located in the South Central Los Angeles ghetto.
While there he wanders around the neighborhood, where he witnesses a group of kids selling crack, and buys the group ice cream.
After saving the group from a racially motivated encounter with a police officer, he finds out they are "soldiers" ofD, a local drug kingpin to whom Nina's brother owes money.
Bulworth eventually makes it to a television appearance arranged earlier by his campaign manager, during which he raps and repeats verbatim statements Nina andD.
have told him about the lives of poor black people and their opinions of various American institutions, like education and employment.
Eventually he offers the solution that "everybody should fuck everybody" until everyone is "all the same color" stunning the audience and his interviewer.
After Bulworth's TV appearance (at the end of which one mysterious assassination attempt occurs) he escapes with Nina and goes with her back to her house where she reveals that she is the assassin he indirectly hired (ostensibly to make the money needed to pay off the debt her brother owes toD) and will now not carry out the job.
Relieved, Bulworth falls asleep for the first time in days in Nina's arms.
Bulworth sleeps deeply for over 36 hours (with Nina tenderly watching over him), during which time the media is abuzz about his mysterious absence on election day.
During this time, various people are shown reacting to the TV coverage and the impact Bulworth's escapade is making on the political/social conversation in the country (race, poverty, inequity, greed).
Bulworth wins the primary election by a landslide.
The next morning the press and Bulworth's campaign managers converge on Nina's house, all eager to talk to himD.
also comes to Nina's house and, having had a change of heart, says he will let Nina's brother work off his debt instead of hurting or killing him.
Bulworth emerges from the bedroom looking rested and, as he steps outside, he invites Nina to go with him; she eventually joins him, after some hesitation.
Bulworth and Nina embrace and begin to kiss as people cheer.
As Bulworth happily accepts a new campaign for the presidency, he is suddenly shot in front of the crowd of reporters and supporters by an agent of the insurance company lobbyists, who were fearful of Bulworth's recent push for single-payer health care.
Bulworth's fate is left ambiguous.
The final scene shows an elderly vagrant, whom Bulworth met previously, standing alone outside a hospital.
He exhorts Bulworth, who is presumably inside, to not be 'a ghost' but 'a spirit' which, as he had mentioned earlier, can only happen if you have 'a song'.
In the final shot of the film, he asks the same of the audience.

A Life Less Ordinary

In Heaven (which resembles a modern police headquarters), angels are tasked with ensuring that mortals on Earth find love.
The "Captain", Gabriel (Dan Hedaya), is upset at reviewing the file of angel partners O'Reilly (Hunter) and Jackson (Lindo), all of whose recent cases have ended in divorce or misery.
Gabriel is being pressed for results, so he introduces a radical new incentive: if their latest case isn't "cracked" – meaning, if the pair in question do not fall, and stay, in love, O'Reilly and Jackson must stay on Earth forever, which does not appeal to them.
They open their case file to learn their tasks.
Celine Naville (Diaz) is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman.
When one of her suitors, a loathsome dentist named Elliott (Stanley Tucci), proposes marriage to her, she offers to say yes, but only if he agrees to play "William Tell" with an apple on his head.
As she takes aim with a pistol, Elliot's nerves fail; his move results in a minor head wound.
Robert Lewis (McGregor) is a janitor employed in the basement of Celine's father's company.
His dreams for writing a best-selling trash novel are shot down by his co-workers.
His manager tells him he is to be replaced by a robot.
As he drowns his sorrows at a local bar, his girlfriend, Lily (KK.
Dodds) tells him she is leaving him for an aerobics instructor.
O'Reilly and Jackson pose as collection agents to repossess Robert's things and evict him from his apartment.
Robert storms to the high-rise office of the company boss, Mr Naville (Ian Holm), while Naville is berating his daughter Celine for the William Tell fiasco.
Security guards run in and start to attack Robert but he holds them off.
When Celine introduces herself, Robert decides to kidnap her.
He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods.
Celine easily slips free but decides to stick around.
She stays for the adventure and revenge against her father, suggesting that they extort a huge ransom.
O'Reilly and Jackson pose as bounty hunters, and contract with Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert.
Robert's first attempt to collect the ransom fails but Celine encourages him.
They go out to a rustic bar, where they sing along to the karaoke machine.
When Robert wakes up the next morning, he is stunned to see that he and Celine have slept together.
Robert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine's blood.
Naville gives O'Reilly and Jackson the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest.
To their disappointment, Robert appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O'Reilly stops his getaway.
Aside, Jackson confesses his fears that the two are not in love yet.
O'Reilly responds, "Jeopardy, Jackson.
Always works".
While O'Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him.
Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel.
As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the towbar and rides along.
As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.
Since they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank with Jackson's pistol.
The robbery goes smoothly, until a security guard shoots at Celine.
Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh.
Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city, to be operated on by Elliot (the closest thing she can find to a discreet medical specialist).
A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sleazy sexual role-playing game with Elliott.
A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliott unconscious.
As they drive away, Celine explains that she only agreed to Elliott's request so that he would help Robert – and, in any case, it's none of Robert's business, since he and Celine aren't "involved," whatever he might think.
Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away.
To get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert's handwriting and sends it to Celine.
Overcome, she runs back to the bar, where Robert has started working as a janitor, and says he has won her heart with the poem.
O'Reilly and Jackson, listening, dance for joy.
until Robert says that he's never written a poem in his life.
Humiliated, Celine runs out again.
But after she's gone, Robert's boss, Al (Tony Shalhoub), knocks some sense into him: Robert has nothing in his life except the improbable love of "an intelligent, passionate, beautiful, rich woman.
so why are you even thinking about it.
" Robert runs after Celine, but is too late: O'Reilly and Jackson, believing they have failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom.
Robert tracks Celine to their hideout.
He knocks O'Reilly down and, struggling with Jackson, tells Celine he loves her.
The door is kicked down by Naville's butler, Mayhew (Ian McNeice), who shoots the two angels in the head (apparently killing them).
Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drive Robert and the two angels' bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a murder-suicide.
In Heaven, Gabriel's secretary begs him to intervene, but he refuses.
He phones God and asks him to do so.
A neighbour releases Celine from the truck.
Taking his gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint.
Robert has had recurring dreams of being saved by being shot through the heart by an "arrow of love".
Celine shoots Robert and the bullet passes through, to hit Mayhew in the shoulder.
After a whispered conference in Al's bar, Robert and Celine walk outside to their wedding.
In an epilogue, Gabriel frees O'Reilly and Jackson from a pair of body bags.
After Gabriel congratulates them on a successful case, the two angels embrace as they prepare to return home.
In a second epilogue (filmed with claymation), Robert and Celine retrieve the suitcase full of money and settle in their new castle in Scotland.

An Ideal Husband

The play opens during a dinner party at the home of Sir Robert Chiltern in London's fashionable Grosvenor Square.
Sir Robert, a prestigious member of the House of Commons, and his wife, Lady Chiltern, are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring, a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns, Mabel Chiltern, and other genteel guests.
During the party, mrs Cheveley, an enemy of Lady Chiltern's from their school days, attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina.
Apparently, mrs Cheveley's dead mentor and lover, Baron Arnheim, convinced the young Sir Robert to sell him a Cabinet secret, a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase.
Sir Robert made his fortune with that illicit money, and mrs Cheveley has the letter to prove his crime.
Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage, Sir Robert submits to her demands.
When mrs Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert's change of heart regarding the canal scheme, the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern, unaware of both her husband's past and the blackmail plot, insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise.
For Lady Chiltern, their marriage is predicated on her having an "ideal husband"—that is, a model spouse in both private and public life that she can worship: thus Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions.
Sir Robert complies with the lady's wishes and apparently seals his doom.
Also toward the end of Act&nbsp;I, Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago.
Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it.
In the second act, which also takes place at Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight mrs Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife.
He also reveals that he and mrs Cheveley were formerly engaged.
After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert, Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel.
He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving.
Once Goring leaves, mrs Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening.
Incensed at Sir Robert's reneging on his promise, she ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room.
Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him.
In the third act, set in Lord Goring's home, Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help, a letter that might be read as a compromising love note.
Just as Goring receives this note, however, his father, Lord Caversham, drops in and demands to know when his son will marry.
A visit from Sir Robert, who seeks further counsel from Goring, follows.
Meanwhile, mrs Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and, misrecognised by the butler as the woman Goring awaits, is ushered into Lord Goring's drawing room.
While she waits, she finds Lady Chiltern's letter.
Ultimately, Sir Robert discovers mrs Cheveley in the drawing room and, convinced of an affair between these two former lovers, angrily storms out of the house.
When she and Lord Goring confront each other, mrs Cheveley makes a proposal.
Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship, she offers to exchange Sir Robert's letter for her old beau's hand in marriage.
Lord Goring declines, accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns' marriage.
He then springs his trap.
Removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer, he binds it to Cheveley's wrist with a hidden lock.
Goring then reveals how the item came into her possession.
Apparently mrs Cheveley stole it from his cousin, Mary Berkshire, years ago.
To avoid arrest, Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff.
After Goring obtains and burns the letter, however, mrs Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern's note from his desk.
Vengefully she plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to the dandified lord.
mrs Cheveley exits the house in triumph.
The final act, which returns to Grosvenor Square, resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending.
Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel.
Lord Caversham informs his son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House.
Lady Chiltern then appears, and Lord Goring informs her that Sir Robert's letter has been destroyed but that mrs Cheveley has stolen her letter and plans to use it to destroy her marriage.
At that moment, Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern's letter, but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee, he assumes it is meant for him, and reads it as a letter of forgiveness.
The two reconcile.
Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Sir Robert's decision to renounce his career in politics, but Lord Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign.
When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister's hand in marriage, still believing he has taken up with mrs Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night's events and the true nature of the letter.
Sir Robert relents, and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed.

The Good Girl

Justine Last (Jennifer Aniston) is a depressed and unmotivated thirty-year-old woman living in a small town in Texas with her husband Phil (John Reilly), a house painter who spends most of his free time smoking marijuana with his best friend, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson).
Justine works at Retail Rodeo, the local big-box store, along with Cheryl (Zooey Deschanel), a cynical, plain-spoken young woman, Gwen (Deborah Rush), a ditzy older woman who manages the cosmetics counter, and Corny (Mike White), a Nazarene security guard.
One morning, Justine notices a new cashier and later introduces herself.
Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) appears quiet and reserved, qualities that the two of them share and, therefore, quickly take a liking to one another.
They begin taking their lunch breaks together and Justine gives Holden rides home.
One time, he invites her in and she accepts.
They swap stories about their lives including how Justine feels unappreciated by Phil and Holden tells her of his obsession with Salinger's novel, The Catcher in the Rye, from where he got his name.
As the weeks go by, Justine and Holden start to bring out the best in each other.
But when Holden makes a pass at her, she rejects him, leaving him dismayed.
He becomes more and more besotted by her.
Some time later, Holden does not show up to work but sends a letter to Justine, writing that if she does not meet him at 5pm that day behind the nearest Chuck Cheese, she will never see him again.
After much consideration, Justine decides to accept Holden's invitation, only to be intercepted by her manager, Jack (John Carroll Lynch), who insists that she take a very ill Gwen to the hospital.
Justine then meets up with Holden.
The two have sex for the first time in a motel room that Justine pays for with her credit card.
As the affair continues, Justine's marriage to Phil continues to deteriorate.
One night, Justine spots Bubba's truck in the parking lot of the motel where she's been meeting Holden.
She becomes convinced that Bubba knows, telling Holden that they need to cool down for a while.
When Justine goes to visit Gwen in the hospital, she is told that Gwen has died after contracting parasites from eating poisonous blackberries that she bought at a roadside fruit stand.
When she returns home, Bubba starts hinting to Justine that he knows about her affair with Holden.
Feeling guilty, Justine suggests that she and Phil should attend a church bible study that Corny, a security guard, had invited them to.
Soon after they arrive, Justine spots the motel desk clerk she encountered with Holden, she grabs Phil and demand they leave immediately.
Justine speaks to Holden in private at work the following day, explaining that what they're doing is wrong and she can't see him in that way anymore.
Bubba tells Justine to meet him at his house.
He blackmails her into a sexual encounter with him by threatening to tell Phil about her affair if she refuses, and she reluctantly gives into his demands.
Holden, who has been following her since the split, sees them through a window.
Holden does not show up for work the next day but is waiting in Justine's car when her shift ends.
He calls Justine a whore and drunkenly demands an apology.
He then says he could kill her husband to free her from her marriage.
Justine becomes desperate to extricate herself from the relationship with Holden.
She goes to talk to his parents and tells them that he is drinking heavily, is mentally ill and that he has imagined a romantic liaison between them.
She goes on to suggest that Holden be hospitalized.
That night after feeling unwell all day, Justine takes a pregnancy test.
The results are positive.
Phil is over the moon but Justine feels uneasy since she doesn't know the father is Holden or Phil.
The next day when Justine arrives at work, Cheryl tells her that someone stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe and that the police suspect Holden.
Justine is called into Jack's office and interrogated about their relationship.
As she leaves for lunch, Justine encounters Holden who brags about having stolen the money and about his plans for them to escape.
Holden tells her to meet her the following morning at a hotel.
When Justine gets home, Phil, Bubba, and Bubba's new girlfriend are all waiting for her so they can celebrate.
The phone rings and Phil answers.
The doctor's office has called; they tell Phil his sperm is "no good".
He tells them his wife is pregnant and they don't know what they are talking about and angrily hangs up.
Bubba assures Phil they made a mistake, that "they don't know everything".
Phil then questions aloud if this means Justine isn't pregnant.
She also assures Phil that they just made a mistake.
The next morning Justine quickly packs a suitcase.
While waiting at the light to turn toward either the hotel or the Retail Rodeo store, she assess her future if she stays versus if she runs away and becomes a fugitive with Holden.
She decides to stay.
She arrives at Retail Rodeo and goes to the manager's office, telling him where Holden is hiding and how long he will be there.
He tells Justine she did good; she's a good girl.
After arriving home, she watches a news report saying that the police have surrounded the hotel where Holden is staying and that Holden shot and killed himself.
The next day, Bubba shows up at Retail Rodeo and tells Justine that Phil opened a statement from the credit card company, which listed the motel that Justine paid for with the card.
Bubba then begs Justine not to tell Phil about their sexual encounter.
When Justine arrives home, Phil is looking at the credit card statement and tearfully asks Justine if she has been having an affair.
After she says, "yes", Phil strikes Justine underneath her eye.
Later, Phil expresses remorse at hitting his wife and asked her if the baby is his.
Wanting to spare Phil any more pain and protect herself, she tells him, yes, it is his baby.
Phil insists on knowing who she had an affair with.

Mr. Destiny

The story begins on "the strangest day" of Larry Burrows' (James Belushi) life (his 35th birthday) consisting of a series of comic and dramatic misadventures.
Larry, who blames all of his life's problems on the fact that he struck out during a key moment of his state high school baseball championship game on his 15th birthday, wishes he had done things differently.
His wish is granted by a guardian angel-like figure named Mike (Michael Caine), and appears at various times as a bartender, a cab driver, and so on.
Larry soon discovers that Mike has transferred Larry into an alternative reality in which he had won the pivotal high school game.
He now finds himself rich and (within his company) powerful, and married to the boss's (Bill McCutcheon) sexy daughter Cindy Jo Bumpers (Rene Russo).
At first, his new life seems perfect, but he soon begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzler (Jon Lovitz) and wife Ellen (Linda Hamilton) from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternative self has created many enemies, like Jewel Jagger (Courteney Cox), and as Larry's problems multiply, he finds himself wishing to be put back into his old life.
The story begins with Larry's car, an old Ford LTD station wagon, stalled out in a dark alley.
Suddenly the pink lights of "The Universal Joint," a bar, come on.
Larry goes inside to call a tow truck, and tells bartender Mike his troubles.
He reviews the day he just had, which ended with his getting fired after discovering his department head Niles Pender's (Hart Bochner) scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners to a group of naive Japanese investors.
He tells Mike that he wishes he'd hit that last pitch out of the park, after which Mike fixes him a drink called "The Spilt Milk".
The Spilt Milk was a drink that gave him his wish that he hit that home run in that championship game.
Larry leaves the bar, walks home (his car apparently towed) and discovers someone else living in his house, which is now fixed up (previously his yard and driveway were muddy and unfinished).
Mike appears as a cab driver and drives him to his "new" home, a mansion in Forest Hills, explaining that he did in fact hit the last pitch and won the game.
He soon discovers that Cindy Jo is his wife and he's the president of his company, Liberty Republic Sporting Goods.
Being a classic car buff, he's shocked to find that he owns a collection of priceless antique automobiles.
Larry soon discovers that Clip has a low-level job in the accounting department and is quite insecure, as opposed to the jokester he was before.
Ellen is shop steward (in both realities) and is married to another man.
Jewel, a forklift operator in the previous reality, is now Larry's mistress and his secretary.
Ellen hates Larry and he discovers that the union is threatening a walkout due to massive layoffs and increased production, since Niles is selling Liberty Republic in both realities.
Seeing Ellen, he realizes how much he misses her and agrees to all the union's demands, providing Ellen agrees to dinner at his favorite restaurant.
She reluctantly agrees, and Larry eventually convinces her that they were married in a previous life.
After discovering that Larry has agreed to union demands, Niles takes revenge, by telling both Cindy Jo and Jewel of Larry's dinner date with Ellen.
He then plots to kill Larry at the office that night.
However, company owner Leo Hansen arrives to deliver a note to Larry, announcing his termination, and Niles kills him by mistake.
Discovering the note, Niles calls the police who attempt to arrest Larry for Leo's murder.
Larry escapes while jealous Jewel creates pandemonium outside in her attempts to shoot him (and shoots out a number of police cars in the process), leading to a police chase.
Larry is eventually cornered in a dark alley but the pink glow of "The Universal Joint" comes on and he runs into the bar.
Unable to find Mike, Larry attempts to make the "Spilt Milk" himself, the ingredients clearly aged.
The flashing lights of the police cars appear and Larry surrenders but instead of cops, a tow truck driver named Duncan enters (the police car lights now tow truck lights).
Confused at first, Larry sees Mike back behind the bar and realizes he's back in his old life.
Larry thanks Mike for everything and, upon exiting the bar, suddenly realizes that the deal with the Japanese investors is happening shortly.
Driven by Duncan to company headquarters, Larry barges into the boardroom, decks Niles and exposes his scheme just as Leo is about to sign the deal.
Thinking everyone forgot his birthday, Larry returns home (which still has the muddy driveway and lawn) to a surprise party with his family and friends in attendance.
Soon after, Cindy Jo and her husband Jackie Earle (Jay Sanders), the company president arrive.
Jackie offers Niles' job to Larry, plus a company car, a new Mercedes and he accepts.
Back in the past, young Larry is about to leave the stadium, still upset about the loss, when he's approached by a mysterious stranger (Mike) who reassures him that everything will be alright.
Larry thanks him for the reassurance, but walks off wondering who Mike thinks he's kidding.

Down with Love

In early 1960s New York City, Barbara Novak arrives in town at Banner House to present her new work, Down with Love, a book the intent of which is to free women from love, teach them to enjoy sex without commitment, and to replace the need for a man with things such as chocolate.
Following her rules would, she believes, help to give women a boost in the workplace and in the world in general.
The men who run Banner House refuse to support the book.
The only way Vikki Hiller, Barbara's editor, can find to promote the book is for Barbara to meet Catcher Block – a successful writer for the magazine Know and a notorious "ladies' man, man's man, man about town" – but he avoids her repeatedly by postponing their dates until she gets fed up, insults him, and walks out.
Catcher's boss and best friend, Peter MacMannus, and Vikki take a liking to one another.
However, their relationship revolves around Barbara and Catcher, and neither is brave enough to express their feelings for the other.
Peter feels overshadowed by Catcher's strong personality, and Vikki wants to see emotional commitment in her lover.
She even assumes Peter must be gay due to his perceived lack of interest.
Barbara starts promoting her book with Vikki's help, and things take off when they get Judy Garland to sing the song "Down with Love" as a promotion to the book on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Sales skyrocket, as housewives and women around the world buy the book and rebel against their men; Catcher now wants to meet Barbara, but now it is she who rejects him.
It all comes to a boiling point when Barbara appears on a national TV show talking about a chapter from the book – "The Worst Kind of Man" – and cites Catcher Block as the perfect example.
Subsequently, Catcher's date rejects him, which infuriates him.
Catcher swears revenge on Barbara and to undo the damage (as he sees it) done by her book by writing the "exposé of the Century" - he will prove to the world that, deep down, all women are the same, they all want love and marriage.
Including Barbara Novak.
He arranges for a casual meeting at a dry cleaner shop, taking advantage of the fact that Barbara has never met or seen him, and he poses as an astronaut, Major Zip Martin, attentive and polite.
Barbara appears to be immediately infatuated with this man who seemingly has no idea who she is, in contrast to men who now avoid her, viewing her as the enemy since the publication of her book.
"Zip" takes her to the most fashionable locations in New York while maintaining considerable sexual tension between them by feigning naivete and a desire to remain chaste until he is "ready" for a physical relationship.
But he starts falling for her, and it gets harder to go through with his plan.
When Barbara finds Catcher/Zip at a party he is almost caught out, and decides it is time to take everything to the next level: he tells Barbara that Catcher Block wants to interview him for an exposé on the NASA space program and asks her to accompany him.
It is his own apartment, and he sets everything up to record her saying she loves him.
But then it is she who reveals the truth: she knew he was really Catcher from the beginning, but she also lied as she is not Barbara Novak but Nancy Brown, once one of Catcher's many secretaries, who fell in love with him while working at Know, but who turned him down when he asked her out because she did not want to be just another one in his long list of romances.
She tells him she did this to be different from all the women he knew, and make him love her.
They both realize that Catcher does love her, but as he is proposing, one of his many lovers appears and thanks Barbara for what she has done for womankind.
Barbara realizes that she does not want love or him as she has become a real "down with love" girl.
Vikki and Peter's relationship also changes when she insults him for helping Catcher.
Peter realizes he is indeed like any other man and takes Vikki to Catcher's apartment to take things to the next level.
Days later, Catcher is completely depressed; all his efforts to win Barbara back have failed.
Even his exposé is ruined now that Barbara has told her story in her own magazine, Now.
Peter is also depressed as his relationship with Vikki is now apparently based only on sex.
Catcher realizes he can do something and writes a new exposé "How Falling In Love With Barbara Novak Made Me A New Man".
He learns there is an opening at Now and goes for an interview with her.
There, he tells her how much she changed him, and it is obvious she wants him but turns him down anyway; he says he wished there could be a middle ground for them "somewhere between a blonde and a brunette", referring to her real persona, where she was a brunette.
As he is leaving her office, he realizes she is not coming after him, but she surprises him on the elevator, showing him a bright red hair style: she has found the middle ground and she wants to be with him.
They fly to Vegas to get married, influencing Vikki and Peter, who also decide to get married.
Their marriage results in a new book intended to end the battle of the sexes, with the pair ultimately singing "Here's To Love".

Chasing Liberty

Anna Foster (Mandy Moore) is the daughter of President of the United States James Foster (Mark Harmon).
After Secret Service agents ruin a first date, Anna demands less supervision.
For his upcoming trip to Prague, the president agrees to assign only two agents to watch over Anna, whose Secret Service codename is Liberty.
In Prague, Anna and her friend Gabrielle La Clare (Beatrice Rosen) attend a concert, where Anna discovers numerous agents in the crowd.
Believing her father has broken his promise, Anna eludes her protectors with Gabrielle's help.
Outside the theater, she asks Ben Calder (Matthew Goode) for a ride on his motorbike.
Unknown to Anna, Ben is a Secret Service agent, and he informs agents Alan Weiss (Jeremy Piven) and Cynthia Morales (Annabella Sciorra) where she can be found.
When the president learns of her behavior, he instructs Ben to guard Anna without revealing his true identity, to give her the illusion of freedom with a guarantee of safety.
Believing she is finally free, Anna jumps into the Vltava River naked, mistaking it for the Danube, and she and Ben climb a rooftop to watch an Offenbach opera being shown in a plaza.
The next morning, Anna calls her parents.
Initially relieved that his daughter is safe, the President's tone changes when he is shown photos of her undressing.
Outraged at her father's tone, Anna decides she will go to the Love Parade in Berlin.
She and Ben board a train, where they meet Scotty McGruff (Martin Hancock), a flighty romantic who gives them a stack of Six Million Dollar Man stickers, instructing them to post them in random places, and one day when they are unhappy, they may come across one and it will make them smile.
Ben discovers that they have boarded a Venice-bound train going in the opposite direction from Berlin.
In Venice, after checking in with agents Weiss and Morales—who are now growing closer romantically—Ben joins Anna and McGruff and together they explore the city.
After McGruff leaves, Anna realizes he has stolen her wallet.
When Anna is recognized by tourists, she and Ben flee.
With no money, they tell a kind-hearted gondolier, Eugenio (Joseph Long), that they recently married against her parents' wishes.
During the free gondola ride, Ben kisses Anna to hide her from their pursuers.
When he learns the "newlyweds" have no place to stay, Eugenio invites them to his house, where they are welcomed by his mother, Maria (Miriam Margolyes).
That night, thinking their kiss was heartfelt, Anna offers herself to Ben, but he rejects her advances.
The next day, Eugenio drives them to the Austrian border, as Weiss and Morales show up at Maria's house and learn from Maria that Anna and Ben are married, which is then reported to Anna's parents.
Upset at Ben's rejection, Anna hitchhikes a ride in a truck, leaving Ben to chase her through the Austrian countryside.
Anna comes to a bridge, where she meets the Jumping Germans, a bungee jumping group.
Ben arrives just as Anna is being strapped into the harness, and insists on jumping with her.
Later that evening at the Jumping Germans' camp, one of the Germans asks Anna to share his tent for the night.
She refuses and flirts with Ben, who rejects her advances again.
Upset, she declares that she will share the German's tent after all; Ben finally admits his feelings for Anna and they spend the night together.
At the Love Parade, as Ben explains his actions on the phone to his fellow agents, Anna discovers his identity.
Enraged at the apparent betrayal, Anna runs off, only to be harassed by a group of men who recognize her.
Ben rescues her, and Anna and her family return to the United States.
While preparing for college, Anna reveals to her mother that her heart is "a little bit broken".
At college, with Weiss and Morales (who plan to marry) still protecting her, Anna sees a Six Million Dollar Man sticker which reminds her of her European adventure.
During Christmas break Anna's father tells her that Ben resigned from the Secret Service and is working as a photographer in London.
During an exchange program to Oxford University Anna visits Ben at the opera, where they kiss, reconcile, and escape on his motorbike.

Mozart and the Whale

Donald Morton (Josh Hartnett) is a taxi driver and drives two Japanese passengers and his pet cockatiel around Spokane, Washington.
Distracted, he bumps into the back of a florist's van, damaging his stock.
Unfazed, Donald and his budgie take their groceries and leave, abandoning his taxi cab and passengers.
He takes his groceries to the self-help group for autistic adults.
Before they head to the park to meet another autistic group, he tells one member, Gracie (Rusty Schwimmer), to gather the women and he'll gather the guys to practice telling personal stories, but keeps getting distracted by performing mathematical sums of the microwaves' depleting numbers.
He notices that Isabelle Sorenson (Radha Mitchell), a new name, has signed up and tells Gracie to let her go first.
At the park, Isabelle tells the women of a childhood memory: she saw that her parents were happy an Olympian had broken a record, so in order to please her parents, and taking what she heard literally, she broke their music records.
Donald tells his story to the men about his ability to do complex sums but couldn't make friends.
Isabelle goes on to tell of when she was raped when she went hitch-hiking.
This causes Gracie to laugh manically.
Heard by Donald, he tries to calm an angry Isabelle down and they find that they have much in common and take a liking to each other.
In the self-help group, after Isabelle talks to Gregory (John Carroll Lynch), a man who is writing notes on his notepad, about Donald, he calls Donald over to ask her to escort him to the Halloween party.
Before Donald can, Isabelle asks Donald out for lunch.
They go to the zoo the following day, and in response to Donald asking on behalf of Gregory, Isabelle asks Donald to escort her.
They agree to meet with their costumes on in the evening.
Donald dresses as a whale but is hesitant about going and leaves Isabelle, dressed as Mozart, waiting.
She goes to his apartment and they both walk around the town talking until the final bus is due, and they share their first kiss.
Unsure when to call, Donald leaves multiple messages on her phone until she finally answers and they go to the amusement park.
In the ring toss, the clanging of the metal rings hitting the bottles and the bell ringing cause her to scream and collapse on the floor.
He takes her back to his filthy apartment and they agree to sleep together.
The following day at the self-help group, Gregory accuses Donald of exploiting his position for sexual favors.
Isabelle makes herself liked by going with Bronwin (Erica Leerhsen), who learns that her father has blood cancer, to wait for her parents to pick her up.
Isabelle takes the liberty of cleaning his apartment while he goes shopping.
When he returns, he's horrified to see that everything is different; the piles of newspaper are stacked neatly, rotting food from the fridge is thrown away and has a new shower curtain.
He gets angry at Isabelle for changing everything.
He later leaves a number of apologetic messages on Isabelle's phone.
The next day, he goes to the hair salon where Isabelle works as a hair stylist to apologize in person, and Isabelle forgives him, introducing him as her boyfriend to the staff.
Isabelle shows Donald an abandoned rooftop, calling this a place where people who don't know where they belong can belong.
She suggests that they can buy a house and her therapist has organised a job interview for a statistic analyst post at a university.
He gets the job and they move into their new house, making it their own.
Donald tells Isabelle that he wants everything to be nice for when his boss, Wallace (Gary Cole) comes for dinner.
Believing that he thinks that she doesn't keep the house nice, Isabelle spites Donald by keeping the pets uncaged, much to Donald's shock when he returns, and she maintains extroverted behavior and tells of her off-the-wall plans for the house.
Donald explodes, but when Isabelle says that they are both crazy, he retaliates by telling her that she is crazier, which leads to her throwing him out.
He stays with Gregory in his house, and after listening to an answer message that Isabelle's rabbit, Bongo, has died, he runs to comfort her.
Isabelle suggests that they should just be friends.
Donald invites Isabelle to a restaurant, where he proposes to her, much to Isabelle's dismay.
She leaves abruptly back home and overdoses.
Donald returns just in time to take her to the hospital, where Isabelle's psychiatrist advises him to leave her alone, testing his willpower to refrain from calling her.
Donald sees Isabelle leaving the university and follows her to the abandoned rooftop, where he expresses that the only nice thing he had left to give her was not to call, to find that Isabelle was waiting for his call and she missed him.
They express their true love with an embrace and kiss.
The movie ends with the happy couple in their home, enjoying Thanksgiving dinner with the self-help group.

Blankman

Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) is a clumsy nerdy repairman, who is a genius and Batman fan.
Darryl has a pure heart and an optimistic Pollyannish personality.
He is childishly naive to the realities of living in an inner city neighborhood.
The area suffers from political corruption and the police are on strike.
It takes the murder of his grandmother, an avid supporter of Alderman Marvin Harris' anti corruption campaign for Mayor, by members of mobster Michael Minelli's gang, to awaken him to the realities of his city's urban decay.
He expresses his frustrations by intervening in a situation and boldly saving an elderly transit passenger from being mugged, and by ranting about the general corruptible state that the city has become.
Darryl was so pure and shielded from reality presumably because of his interest in inventing, that he does not even realize that there is a "crackhouse in front of [their] flat".
He tries to storm into it unarmed and rebuke the gang members, oblivious to the hazardous stupidity of doing so.
Awakened to the city's issues, Darryl is inspired to become a vigilante super hero.
He uses his technical expertise to create weapons and gadgets.
His brother Kevin, a tabloid news cameraman, goes along with this fantasy, believing that it's Darryl's way to cope with the murder of his grandmother.
Darryl demands an audience with the police commissioner, but the police are not impressed with his actions, ridicule him, and arrest him for disturbing the peace.
Darryl is released on orders to see a psychiatrist.
The psychiatrist calls Darryl normal, but a geek, infuriating Kevin, who the psychiatrist then attempts to psychoanalyze.
After Darryl is nearly killed trying to protect a citizen on the street, Kevin tries to get him to tone his activities down, advising him to start a neighborhood watch.
After he delivers a woman's baby in an elevator, he is asked for his name.
Darryl just stares, and Kevin replies, "He's gone blank, ma'am".
Both the lady and the reporters interpret this as a name: Blankman.
Over time he protects various other people in the community, building up a reputation and inspiring both the town and other real life superheroes.
Kevin, hoping to win the affections of Kimberly Jonz, a reporter at his TV station, begs Darryl to allow her to interview him.
He relents, on the condition that she wear a carnation.
He brings her to his secret hideout, an abandoned subway station, and they talk about how he took up his duties to memorialize his grandmother and prevent crime.
Impressed by his heroics and modesty, Kimberly immediately falls in love with Darryl and she kisses him causing him to have an erection.
Mayor Harris, who refused Minelli's attempts at bribery, attempts to bring in outside money to pay the IOUs the city has been giving its workers.
He also requests that Blankman be there to protect the people and receive a special award.
As the money is released, Minelli's henchmen storm the bank and take the mayor hostage, threatening to detonate explosives.
At the police chief's request and the crowd's chants, Blankman attempts to save the mayor but is unable to defuse all the bombs.
He reveals his identity to the mayor and tells him of his grandmother's support for the mayor.
Mayor Harris wishes him well, warning him to run and says he will tell mrs Walker about Darryl.
Blankman runs out screaming as the bank explodes, killing Harris.
The crowd, seeing his failure, turn on him, chasing him down the street.
Darryl then gives up his heroic works for a normal life, getting a job at a McDonald's.
Wanting a great story Kevin's boss Larry Stone, a tabloid news junkie, manages to contact Minelli and trades knowledge of Blankman's love for Kimberly in exchange for an exclusive interview.
In the midst of doing research on Minelli and Darryl's grandmother's death, Kimberly calls Kevin with the news.
As Kevin answers, Minelli takes Kimberly hostage.
Minelli issues a verbal threat to Kevin (thinking he is talking to Blankman), telling him he will kill Kimberly if Blankman does not show up.
Kevin rushes to Darryl's workplace with the news, but Darryl refuses to help wanting a normal life.
Kevin finally convinces him with the news that Minelli had their grandmother killed and that he will wear the costume Darryl designed for him.
The two rush to Darryl's underground lair where he again turns into Blankman.
Kevin becomes his new sidekick but without a name.
He just goes by "Other Guy".
The two heroes then rush to the TV station.
After shooting the reporter interviewing him, Minelli becomes fed up.
While threatening Stone, Blankman and Other Guy crash through the window and attempt a rescue.
The two engage in a fight with Minelli's goons, losing.
They are placed in a water tank and left to slowly drown.
Stone and Kimberly are chained to desks and left to die as Minelli has hidden bombs in the building.
At this point, Blankman calls in J-5, his robot assistant, to save them.
J-5 drills a hole in the tank and the pair kick their way to freedom at the last minute.
The duo then search for the bombs, finding them in a women's bathroom.
Activating J-5's "bomb disposal mode," Blankman stuffs the explosives inside and frees Kimberly.
Stone is left behind, a joke Other Guy wants to play on his boss.
Once outside, the explosives detonate, destroying J-5.
Distraught, Blankman swears revenge.
Tracking Minelli to his hideout in a factory, the two prepare for the final battle.
Other Guy, however, is overconfident and is wounded because his costume is not bulletproof like Darryl's.
Blankman then defeats Minelli's goons with his electric "newchucks" (nunchucks).
Just when Minelli is about to kill Other Guy, Blankman activates his jet-powered roller blades and captures Minelli and delivers him to the police.
Blankman is once again acknowledged as a hero (this time, along with Other Guy) by the people, receiving the Mayor Harris Award for outstanding community service at a ceremony in their honor.
Other Guy receives a Blankman t-shirt (much to Kevin's disgust).
After the ceremony, Kevin introduces Kimberly to "Darryl".
The two make light conversation until Kimberly pretends to see a purse snatcher, putting Darryl on alert.
Kimberly then reveals she knows that they are Blankman and Other Guy, and she kisses Darryl to prove it.
Darryl falls to the ground after getting the same embarrassing reaction he had the first time while Kevin and Kimberly laugh at him.
The film ends with a shot of a banner that reads "We Love You Blankman.
and the Other Guy".

Connie and Carla

Connie (Nia Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette) are two performers whose lifelong friendship and co-obsession with musical theater have brought nothing but career dead ends.
Despite this they continue their optimism, hosting a variety act at an airport lounge.
After accidentally witnessing a mafia hit in Chicago, they go on the run, landing in Los Angeles.
After being fired from a beauty salon, they pose as drag queens and audition to host a drag revue at a gay club called "The Handlebar".
Because they sing their own songs (a rarity for queens), they are hired, and their variety show (at first titled What a Drag (Pun Intended.
) then later re-titled Connie and Carla and the Belles of the Balls after they add a few friends to the act) becomes a hit.
Things are going smoothly but the two make a pact not to let men interfere with their life.
This causes conflict when Connie falls for Jeff (David Duchovny), the straight brother of Robert (Stephen Spinella), one of their drag queen friends.
As the show gets bigger, the two convince the club owner, Stanley (Ian Gomez), to convert it into a full dinner theater, and eventually their popularity threatens to expose them.
On the official opening night of the dinner theater, the mob killers catch up with them.
But with the help of their drag queen friends, and to great applause from the audience (who think it is part of their act), Connie and Carla take them down.
They ultimately confess their real identities to the audience and are accepted for who they are.
Connie reveals herself to Jeff, who arrives after the chaos.
He accepts her and becomes her boyfriend.

She's All That

Zack Siler (Freddie Prinze, Jr) is the big man on campus at his Southern California high school.
His popular but narcissistic girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), ditches him for a faded reality TV star from The Real World, Brock Hudson (Matthew Lillard), whom she met on spring break in Florida.
Although bitter over the break-up, Zack consoles himself by claiming that Taylor is replaceable by any girl from the school.
Zack's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr.
(Paul Walker), disagrees and challenges him to a bet on whether Zack can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks, a coveted position held by the most popular girl in school.
Dean picks out Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), a dorky, solitary, unpopular art student, as his choice for Zack.
Zack approaches and attempts to befriend Laney in the hope of subsequently transforming her into prom queen material.
His first encounter with her is a complete failure, when she pointedly ignores his advance and walks away from him.
With help from Laney's friend, Jesse Jackson (Elden Henson), Zack eventually is successful in getting Laney to take him to a theater lounge frequented by artists and performers.
Intending to deter him, Laney arranges for Zack to be called onto the stage and perform to his surprise.
Zack manages to improvise a show with the Hacky Sack he happens to carry in his pocket.
Laney is impressed by the performance, but rejects him again after he attempts to charm her.
Zack befriends her brother, Simon (Kieran Culkin), and in an attempt to stop this, Laney agrees to go to the beach with him once.
She starts to make friends in the popular crowd as they get a chance to know her.
Zack then successfully persuades her to attend a party at Preston's (Dulé Hill) house the same night, and he employs his sister Mac (Anna Paquin) to give her a makeover, transforming her into a stunning beauty.
Laney's attendance at Preston's party sparks jealousy in Taylor, who then humiliates Laney, but Laney is consoled by Zack, who has by now developed a true affection for her.
As a result of her new appearance and Zack's interest, Laney is nominated for Prom Queen and begins an uneasy battle with Taylor for the crown.
Taylor faces humiliation of her own when Brock informs her their relationship is over, and that he only used her to increase his own popularity (which proves successful with the producers of MTV offering him his own show).
In the meantime, Dean begins to show an interest in Laney as her popularity begins to soar and Zack's victory becomes more imminent.
Dean tries to invite Laney as his prom partner in an attempt to ruin Zack's attempt to boost Laney's winning chance with his own popularity, but Laney refuses.
After falling out with Zack, Dean deliberately tells Laney about the bet and she forces a confession from Zack in public.
Feeling objectified and betrayed, Laney refuses to see Zack again.
Unable to reconcile with Laney, Zack ends up attending the prom with his sister, while Taylor arrives alone, thinking that Zack is still interested in her despite his refusal of her advances.
A disheartened Laney reluctantly dresses up after some persuasion from her father Wayne (Kevin Pollak) and goes to the dance with Dean when he shows up at her house in a tuxedo to invite her again to be his prom date.
At the prom, after a dance scene presided over by the school's resident DJ (Usher Raymond), Mac meets Jesse and they become friends.
Dean boasts to Preston and others in the bathroom that he is succeeding in seducing Laney and has rented a hotel room with intention of having sex with her.
Jesse overhears this and warns Mac and Zack.
Taylor is then crowned Prom Queen with just over half the votes; she begins a long berating speech which is interrupted by the microphone being turned off by a teacher.
By now, the students have seen Taylor for who she is, thanks to Mac revealing her actions against Laney and her involvement with Dean to sabotage Zack.
As a result, Taylor is further humiliated when she loses her popularity and her friends.
Laney leaves the prom with Dean, while Zack attempts to intervene but loses track of them.
When Laney returns to her home, Zack is there waiting for her, along with her father and Simon who are waiting up for her.
Laney explains how she fought off Dean's advances by deafening him with an air horn.
Zack confesses his true feelings to Laney, and asks for forgiveness as well as the chance to further their relationship, which she grants.
Laney tells Zack that she is considering art school after graduation, and Zack jokingly tells her that she has inspired him to pursue a career in performance art.
After their first dance and kiss, Laney asks Zack about his bet with Dean (which is now lost), and Zack responds that he will gracefully honor the terms.
At the graduation ceremony, the terms of the bet are revealed, Zack must appear nude on stage because he lost.
After his name is called, Zack heads to the stage wearing only a graduation cap and strategically carrying a soccer ball.
In the final shot he is not visible, but we see Laney with the soccer ball being thrown to her and the rest of the students reacting to Zack no longer having it for cover.

Making Mr. Right

Jeff Peters (John Malkovich) is an emotionally repressed scientist who cannot stand others because of their intellectual inferiority.
He dreams of deep space exploration, which would be difficult because of the lack of human contact for long periods of time.
He develops the Ulysses android (which looks exactly like him) for the purpose of space exploration, since an android would not be affected by the isolation.
Frankie Stone (Ann Magnuson) is hired to do public relations for the project.
As a part of her job, she must get to know the android better, in order to "humanize" him for the benefit of the project's sponsors in Congress.
However, in his interaction with her, the android develops emotions and develops better social skills than the scientist himself.
At one point the android impersonates Jeff in order to leave the laboratory, and stows away in Frankie's Chevrolet Corvair.
After escaping he encounters human society at a shopping mall, buys a tuxedo, goes on a date with a woman (Laurie Metcalf) who thinks he is Jeff, reducing her to an emotional wreck, and then loses his head (literally) over Frankie's best friend Trish (Glenne Headly) who has taken refuge in Frankie's apartment after walking out on her husband who is a star on the popular daytime soap opera New Jersey.

Sideways

Miles Raymond is an aspiring&nbsp;– but unsuccessful&nbsp;– writer, a wine aficionado and a divorced, depressed, borderline alcoholic middle-aged English teacher living in San Diego, who takes his soon-to-be-married actor friend and former college roommate, Jack Cole, on a road trip through Santa Ynez Valley wine country.
Though still recognized on occasion, Jack's acting career appears to have peaked years ago, when he had a role in a popular TV soap but now does commercial voice-overs and plans to enter his future father-in-law's successful real estate business after he's married.
Miles wants to spend the week relaxing, golfing, enjoying good food and wine; however, much to Miles' consternation, Jack is on the prowl and wants one last sexual fling before settling into domestic life.
In the wine country, the pair visit Miles' favorite restaurant, The Hitching Post II, and meet Maya, an attractive, intelligent waitress with whom Miles is casually acquainted.
Jack senses that Maya is interested in Miles, who downplays his friend's intuition, and tells Jack that Maya is married.
Jack tells Maya that Miles' manuscript has been accepted for publication, even though it is only being considered.
Later, at a tasting in a local winery, they meet an attractive wine pourer named Stephanie, who is also acquainted with Maya.
Jack is immediately attracted to Stephanie and arranges a double date, to include Miles and Maya, and tells Miles that he learned Maya is no longer married ("sans rock", as he describes it).
During the date, Miles gets drunk and telephones Vicki, his ex-wife, after learning from Jack earlier that day that she has remarried.
They return to Stephanie's home, where Jack and Stephanie immediately adjourn to her bedroom for sex, while Miles and Maya connect through their mutual interest in wine.
Miles tells Maya about his book, and Maya says she is finishing a master's degree in horticulture so she can leave serving.
Miles makes a gauche pass at Maya, which she rejects.
They leave separately, but not before he gives her a copy of his manuscript.
As the week progresses, Jack's affair with Stephanie continues, to the point where he believes he's falling in love with her; he bonds with her daughter and makes the suggestion to Miles that they move there for him to be closer to Stephanie.
After spending the day together, Miles and Maya return to her apartment and have sex.
The next day, Miles lets it slip that Jack is to be married.
Disgusted with the dishonesty, Maya dumps Miles and later tells Stephanie who, furious and devastated to learn she's been used, hits Jack repeatedly and breaks his nose using her motorcycle helmet.
On finding out his manuscript has been rejected again, Miles drinks heavily, and when the server cuts him off, he ends up drinking from the spit bucket, but Jack eases him out of the room in time.
That night, with Stephanie gone, Jack hooks up with another waitress named Cammi, who recognized him from his acting career.
Hours later, Jack shows up back at the motel room he shares with Miles&nbsp;– naked and confessing that Cammi's husband came home early while she and Jack were having sex.
Jack explains he was forced to flee without his clothes and wallet (which contains a pair of irreplaceable wedding rings).
Jack convinces Miles to drive him back to Cammi's house and sneak inside, where he discovers Cammi and her husband having sex.
Miles spies Jack's wallet, grabs it and runs from the house, barely escaping Cammi's irate husband, who pursues him in the nude.
To explain the broken nose and cover up the infidelity to his fiancée, Jack runs Miles' convertible into a tree, giving the appearance they had been in an accident.
The pair return to the home of Jack's fiancée, where he is welcomed with open arms, and Miles drives away in his battered car.
Following the wedding ceremony, Miles runs into his ex-wife Vicki and meets her new husband.
After learning that she is also pregnant, Miles accepts that he will never get Vicki back.
Alone, he drinks his prized wine, a 1961 Château Cheval Blanc, from a disposable coffee cup at a fast-food restaurant and falls into an even deeper depression.
After some time passes, Miles returns to the routine of teaching school; coming home one afternoon, he receives a voice-mail from Maya, who says she enjoyed his manuscript and invites him to visit.
Ultimately, Miles is seen driving back to Santa Ynez and knocking on Maya's door.

Her father Simon (David Keith), a second-generation restaurateur, disapproves of Terri's plans, stating that being a singer may not be a worthwhile life choice.
In reality, his opposition stems from resentment; Simon turned down a similar scholarship to run his parents' restaurant when they became ill; he is intimidated by the thought of his daughter flourishing where he couldn't bring himself to try.
Terri is very close to her elder brother Paul (Jason Ritter) who fully supports her dream, despite what their dad says.

However, Terri's mother Frances (Rita Wilson) feels differently; knowing that Paul would have wanted Terri to attend the program, she convinces her surviving offspring to go.
Frances tells Simon that Terri plans to live with her aunt Nina (Rebecca De Mornay) in Palm Desert for the summer and allows her daughter to travel to Los Angeles.
Terri arrives in Los Angeles and weathers some difficult ordeals: her jacket is stolen, her cab driver is crabby, and when she arrives at the music school, the door is locked; fellow student Jay (Oliver James) lets her in and Terri arrives safely.
While at the program, Terri makes new friends and learns a great deal about music, but problems arise when she is plagued by memories of the car crash which took Paul's life and finds it increasingly difficult to keep her participation in the program a secret from her father.
Throughout the film, Terri develops a mutual fondness for Jay, but she faces competition from Robin Childers (Lauren Mayhew), who was involved with Jay the previous summer.
Although Robin still harbors feelings for Jay, it is obvious that he does not reciprocate these feelings.
Jay tries to get Robin to cease her efforts to keep him and Terri apart.
On one occasion, she kisses him just as Terri walks in.
Jay pushes Robin away, but Terri runs off in tears, ignoring Jay's insistence that the kiss meant nothing.
Later, finding him drunk, Terri and her roommate Denise (Dana Davis) take Jay elsewhere to sober up.
When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song they've been working on for the scholarship contest.
At home, Simon learns of Terri's ruse and becomes furious.
On the final day, Simon comes to the school and Terri finds him packing up her belongings; he reams his daughter for disobeying and deceiving him, and for turning his own sister and wife against him.
She begs him to let her finish what she started here and not let the summer go to waste.
Ultimately, realizing how selfish he had been acting concedes and allows her to perform.
Terri and Jay then perform the song they wrote with Terri, dedicating it to Paul.
The scholarship prize is won by Denise, yet Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents.
He is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simon's own (their argument, and Paul's subsequent restriction to his bedroom).
Terri's teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might.
Over the end credits, Terri performs for her parents and Nina, with Jay cheering her on.

The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love

It is spring.
Randy Dean is a 17-year-old student in her final year with poor grades, only one friend - Frank, a gay Latino - secret cigarette and marijuana habits and a cashier’s job at a gas station with fellow worker Regina.
Shunned by other students for her tomboyish personality and appearance, she spends most of her free time either by herself or in illicit meetings with her romantic partner Wendy, a married woman who drops by the gas station when it pleases her, even though Randy knows they are in a dead-end relationship.
Randy lives with her lesbian aunt Rebecca and her girlfriend Vicky, as well as Rebecca's ex-girlfriend Lena, who has no place to stay and is living with them until she finds somewhere else she can go to.
One day Evie Roy stops in a pristine Range Rover, unsure if her tires need air.
Randy recognizes her from school and talks to her for the first time.
Evie is an only child living with her well-off, cultured mother, Evelyn, who has a difficult relationship with her remarried husband.
Randy and Evie start passing notes in school and hanging out with each other, although Evie does not reveal this to her cliquish friends.
During this time, Randy is approached by Wendy's jealous husband Ali at the gas station, who grabs Randy and warns her to stay away from his wife.
Randy spends much of her time with Evie hanging out in meadows, trading music (opera and Mozart from Evie, punk rock from Randy) and talking.
When Wendy next visits her, Randy rejects her, telling her she has a new girlfriend, Evie.
Evie breaks up with her boyfriend Hayjay after he complains of her distant attitude towards him.
Later, apparently on a spur of the moment, she lends Randy a copy of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, which Randy starts to devour.
Inviting Evie to her family’s small house for dinner one evening, Randy reveals to her that she has lived with Rebecca and Vicky since Randy's devoutly religious mother abandoned her to devote all her time to an Operation Rescue-like group.
On the front steps of Rebecca's house, they kiss for the first time.
Evie records it in her diary later, apparently wondering what it all means.
Randy and Evie experiment with how "out" they can be as lesbians, nervously holding hands at a local diner.
Remembering Randy’s warning of how intolerant the town can be, Evie nevertheless breaks the news to her three closest friends.
One girl is supportive (if confused), but the other two are hostile to the idea: one of them says, “God, Evie, if you were gonna turn gay you think you could at least choose someone who’s pretty.
” Meanwhile, Randy’s grades continue to plummet and the school warns her she will not graduate; Randy hides this information from Rebecca.
When Evie’s mother leaves on a business trip, the girls take the opportunity to cook a huge meal, indulging in wine and marijuana.
That night, they make love, then fall asleep in Evie’s mother’s bed.
The next morning, it is Evie's 18th birthday; Evelyn returns prematurely with presents for her, but is shocked by the mess in the kitchen and the rest of the house.
Furiously searching the upstairs, she discovers Evie and Randy, but only realizes Randy is a girl when she runs past her on her way out.
Rebecca, who has learned that Randy will not be graduating high school, goes over to go to Frank’s house with Vicky and Lena, where Randy had told them she would be staying the night.
Rebecca threatens Frank until, panicked, he turns over Evie’s phone number.
She calls, but Evie and Randy have already absconded and she is left talking to a furious Evelyn.
Evie and Randy, crying, scared and accusatory, take refuge in a motel.
Randy finally calls Wendy, who comes out, pays for the room and tries to comfort the girls.
Ali sees her car in the parking lot, however, and comes bursting in, eventually attracting Evelyn, Rebecca, Vicky, Lena, Frank, and Evie’s three friends, who were driving past reading aloud from Rita Mae Brown’s Rubyfruit Jungle (apparently still processing Evie’s news).
The movie ends with Randy and Evie kissing and hugging in the open motel room doorway while everyone else argues in the background at top volume.

Million Dollar Baby

Margaret "Maggie" Fitzgerald, a waitress from a Missouri town in the Ozarks, shows up in the Hit Pit, a run-down Los Angeles gym owned and operated by Frankie Dunn, an old, cantankerous boxing trainer.
Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses.
Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's "too old" to begin a boxing career at her age.
Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee—and the film's narrator—encourages and helps her.
Frankie's prize prospect, "Big" Willie Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Dunn's rejecting offers for a championship bout.
With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie.
He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager.
Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local pastor, with whom he spars verbally at daily Mass.
Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory.
A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her lightweight bouts with first-round knockouts.
Earning a reputation for her KOs, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.
Eventually, Frankie risks putting her in the junior welterweight class, where her nose is broken in her first match.
Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter.
Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday.
Out of loyalty, she declines.
Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a Gaelic nickname on her.
The two travel Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but she berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.
Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight.
He secures Maggie a $1 million match in Las Vegas, Nevada against the WBA women's welterweight champion, Billie "The Blue Bear", a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter.
Overcoming a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but after a round has ended, Billie knocks her out with an illegal sucker punch from behind after the bell has sounded to indicate the end of the round.
Before Frankie can pull the corner stool out of the way which was inappropriately placed on its side by Frankie's assistant, Maggie lands hard on it, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent quadriplegic.
Frankie is shown experiencing the first three of the five stages of grief: first seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger and later trying to bargain with God through prayer.
In a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive accompanied by an attorney and only after having first visited Disneyland and Universal Studios Hollywood; their only concern is to transfer Maggie's assets to them.
She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and inform the IRS of her mother's welfare fraud if they ever show their faces again.
As the days pass, Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for an infected leg.
She asks a favor of Frankie: to help her die, declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life.
A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts.
The pastor Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.
Frankie sneaks in one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows.
Just before administering a fatal injection of adrenaline, he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, Mo Chuisle (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): Irish for "my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse").
He never returns to the gym.
Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character.
The last shot of the film shows Frankie sitting at the counter of a diner where Maggie once took him.

Gregory Underwood (John Gordon Sinclair) is an awkward teenager who plays in his school football team.
They are not doing very well, so the coach (Jake D'Arcy) holds a trial to find new players.
Dorothy (Dee Hepburn), turns up and, despite the coach's sexist misgivings, proves to be a very good player.
She subsequently takes Gregory's place as centre forward, and Gregory in turn replaces his friend Andy (Robert Buchanan) as goalkeeper.
Gregory is all for her making the team, as he finds her very attractive.
However, he has to compete for her attention with all the other boys who share the same opinion.
Gregory initially confides in his best friend Steve (William Greenlees), the most mature of Gregory's circle of friends, and asks him for help in attracting Dorothy.
Steve, however, is unable to assist him.
Acting on the advice of his precocious 10-year-old sister, Madeleine (Allison Forster), he awkwardly asks Dorothy out on a date.
She accepts, but Dorothy's friend, Carol (Caroline Guthrie), shows up at the rendezvous instead and informs Gregory that something had come up; Dorothy will not be able to make it.
He is disappointed, but Carol talks him into taking her to the chip shop.
When they arrive, she hands him off to another friend, Margo (Carol Macartney), and leaves.
By then, Gregory is rather confused, but goes for a walk with the new girl.
On their stroll, they encounter a waiting Susan (Clare Grogan), another of Dorothy's friends, and Margo leaves.
Susan confesses that it was all arranged by her friends, including Dorothy.
She explains, "It's just the way girls work.
They help each other".
They go to the park and talk.
At the date's end, Gregory is more than pleased with Susan, and the two kiss numerous times on his doorstep before calling it a night and arranging a second date.
Madeleine, who had been watching from the window, quizzes him on his date and calls him a liar when he claims he did not kiss Susan.
Gregory's friends, Andy and Charlie (Graham Thompson), are even more inept with girls but see Gregory at various times with three apparent dates, and are envious of his new success.
They try to hitchhike to Caracas, where Andy has heard the women greatly outnumber the men, but fail at that as well.

Being Julia

Set in London in 1938, the film focuses on highly successful and extremely popular theatre actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening), whose gradual disillusionment with her career as she approaches middle age has prompted her to ask her husband, stage director Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons), and his financial backer Dolly de Vries (Miriam Margolyes) to close her current production to allow her time to travel abroad.
They persuade her to remain with the play throughout the summer; and Michael introduces her to Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), an enterprising American, who confesses his deep appreciation of her work.
Seeking the passion missing from her marriage, and anxious to fill the void left when her close friend Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood) suggested they part ways to avoid scandalous gossip, Julia embarks on a passionate affair with the young man and begins to support him so he may enjoy the glamorous lifestyle to which she has introduced him.
Their relationship revives her, sparking a distinct change in her personality.
Always hovering in the background and offering counsel is the spirit of her mentor, Jimmie Langton (Michael Gambon), the theatrical manager who gave Julia her start and made her a star, while flesh-and-blood Evie (Juliet Stevenson) serves as her personal maid, dresser, and confidante.
Michael suggests they invite Tom to spend time at their country estate, where he can become better acquainted with their son Roger (Tom Sturridge).
At a party there, Tom meets aspiring actress Avice Crichton (Lucy Punch), and, when Julia sees him flirting with the pretty young woman, she becomes jealous and anxious and angrily confronts him.
He slowly reveals himself to be a callous, social-climbing, gold-digging gigolo, and Julia is shattered when their affair comes to an end.
Avice, now romantically involved with Tom, asks him to bring Julia to see her perform in a play in the hope the actress will induce her husband to cast her in a supporting role in Julia's upcoming project.
The play is dreadful, and Avice is not much better.
Backstage, Julia compliments her even-worse co-star and barely acknowledges Avice, although she promises to tell Michael about her.
Afterwards, she forces Tom to admit he loves Avice, then - although her heart is broken by his admission - she assures him she will insist the ingenue be cast in her next play.
When Julia's performance in her current play begins to suffer from her personal discontent, Michael closes the production; and Julia visits her mother (Rosemary Harris) and her Aunt Carrie (Rita Tushingham) in Jersey, where Lord Charles comes to visit her.
Julia suggests a romantic tryst, and he gently tells her that he's gay.
Meanwhile, back in London, Avice auditions for Michael; and, although Julia resents it, she is given the role.
Julia returns home to begin rehearsals for the new play.
Shortly after, she learns from her son that Avice has been one of Michael's casual trysts.
Still, she is uncharacteristically solicitous toward the girl, making suggestions that place her in the spotlight and insisting her own wardrobe be drab to allow Avice to shine.
What her director and fellow cast members don't realize is there's a method to her seeming madness - Julia has planned her sweet revenge for the opening night performance, during which she successfully affirms her position as London theatre's foremost diva by upstaging every aspect of her performance.

View from the Top

Donna Jensen is a girl from a small town in Nevada who wishes to see the world in order to get away from her unhappy life of living in a trailer with her alcoholic mother, a former Las Vegas showgirl, and her abusive, alcoholic stepfather, where she feels miserable and lonely.
After graduating from high school, Donna tries to make ends meet by working as a clerk in a Big Lots.
After her boyfriend, Tommy, leaves her for another girl, she goes to a bar where she sees a talk show segment about Sally Weston, who has written a memoir called My Life in the Sky, and decides to follow her destiny by becoming a flight attendant.
Her first position is at a small, seedy California commuter airline called Sierra, where she works with Sherry, a senior attendant, and also gets an intern herself, named Christine.
After working for several months, this success builds up her confidence and encourages her to attend open interviews for Royalty Airlines.
She convinces Sherry and Christine to join her at Royalty Airlines.
While Christine and Donna get in, Sherry does not, and remains in Sierra Airlines.
After getting the job, Donna puts her heart and soul into the training camp, and, after meeting Weston, she is determined to be assigned to the top route, "Paris, First Class, International".
Alas, when the assignments are posted, Donna is shocked and disappointed to discover that, instead of the top route, she has been assigned to a commuter route in Cleveland.
Christine, who had initially struggled with the material and procedures, has inexplicably been assigned the high-priority New York City route, much to the dismay of Donna.
A few months later, by chance, Donna runs into Christine in Cleveland.
Donna knows from previous experience that Christine has the airplane soap from Sally's house during their training sessions, but is still shocked when Christine empties her handbag to reveal all manner of Royalty Air items.
Even the smallest theft is strictly prohibited by Royalty Airlines, and could mean termination.
Still sure there was some sort of error in her route assignment, Donna turns to Weston for help.
Through a course of events, Donna discovers that Christine had switched their test booklets when they were being handed up to their trainer.
With that, Donna realizes that Christine has cheated her way to the top route, wanting success herself but knowing that Donna would pass better.
When Sally asks to have airline security spy on Christine's flight - to see if she stole any property (a code blue) - Christine gets caught and is fired.
Donna gets the chance to re-take her exam and achieves a perfect score, resulting in being assigned a Paris, First Class, International route.
However, following her "destiny" means deciding between a boyfriend, Ted, and her career.
She chooses the latter.
Though she gets all that she wants - Paris, first class, etc.
- Donna realizes that she is still unhappy.

How to Deal

Halley Marie Martin (Mandy Moore) is a 17-year-old high school student who is disillusioned with love after seeing many dysfunctional relationships around her.
Her parents are now divorced and her father, Len Martin (Peter Gallagher), a radio talk show host, has a new young girlfriend that the entire family despises.
Her mother, Lydia (Allison Janney), is now always alone while her sister, Ashley, is so overwhelmed by her upcoming wedding with Lewis Warsher that she barely exists in the house.
The shallowness of all the teens at her school convinces Halley that finding true love is impossible.
When Halley walks in on her best friend Scarlett having sex with her boyfriend, the high school soccer champ, Michael Sherwood, Halley tries to warn her of the complications that lie ahead.
Ignoring her advice, Scarlett embarks on a summer fling with Michael.
In the meantime, Halley must deal with Ashley and the rest of the Martins must deal with her soon-to-be in-laws, Lewis' overbearing Southern parents, who have an African American maid.
In the meantime, Halley runs into classmate Macon Forrester, a slacker who never shows up for biology and is more interested in having fun than school work.
He is Michael Sherwood's best friend.
Then a few weeks later, Michael dies of a heart defect on the soccer field while Halley, Scarlett and other classmates watch helplessly.
This event changes the lives of Halley and Scarlett forever.
While Scarlett does her best to look beautiful for Michael at his funeral, Macon gives a moving speech about his friend.
Struggling with Michael's death, Scarlett, at age sixteen, soon learns that she is pregnant with his child.
With Halley at her side, Scarlett reveals the pregnancy to her mother.
Halley's father, Len Martin, marries his mistress, Lorna, in a beach-side ceremony, with guests from all over the world, or "within his radio frequency", as Halley puts it.
Halley and Macon eventually start a relationship.
He takes her to his and Michael's favorite hangout and once come close to having sex.
Halley and her mother get into an argument and on New Year's Eve, Halley sneaks out with Macon to a party.
Again, they come very close to having sex but this time Halley stops it and Macon is upset.
On their way home, they are both upset and distracted and hit a tree.
Halley gets a broken arm, but otherwise they both walk away from it unharmed, but Halley breaks up with Macon saying that she can't wait around for him to grow up.
Later things go awry when Halley finds Ashley drunk on the family's front porch.
Finding a male stripper's thong around her neck, Halley witnesses the break-up of her sister's engagement.
She also learns that her mother sneaks out once a week to have sex with a man she met a couple of weeks previously, Steve.
After another make-up, Lewis proposes to Ashley again, this time at a crowded airport: she says yes.
On the day of Ashley and Lewis' wedding, Macon bursts into Len's radio studio, professing his apologies and love to Halley.
He then heads to the wedding.
On the way, he finds Scarlett, who insisted on walking to the wedding, going into labor on the side of the road.
He puts her in the car and walks into the wedding, getting Halley's attention.
The three rush to the hospital, leaving Scarlett's mother behind in the rush.
While Scarlett is having her baby, Halley makes a list of all the little things she hates about Macon, the way his hair falls over his face, the way his voice gets low when he's serious, the way he bites his lip when he's nervous and the way his eyebrow twitches.
Halley playfully uses Macon's 'Jedi Mind Trick' and they kiss and dance briefly in the hallway.
The movie ends as Halley and Macon embrace and viewers see that Scarlett gave birth to a baby boy.

100 Girls

After leaving a party at a women's dormitory (aka the "virgin vault"), Matthew (Jonathan Tucker) is trapped in an elevator with an unknown, and unseen, woman when the power goes out.
Matthew and this unknown woman have sex in the dark.
When Matthew wakes up in the morning—still in the elevator—he finds himself alone with a pair of her panties.
On a mission to find his mystery maiden by finding a matching bra for the panties, Matthew becomes the maintenance man of the virgin vault.
After releasing mice, he goes room to room, setting traps.
He convinces the panicked women to leave their rooms and then starts to look for a match.
When he is unsuccessful, he continues to break things (such as the air conditioning) in an effort to find his woman.
He also fixes the television set, which is greatly received by women he refers to as "Jane-ites", as they have a great interest in films adapted from books by Jane Austen.
He doesn't get much help from his roommate Rod (James DeBello), who keeps telling him to give up, and together they philosophize about men and women.
Rod tells him that he doesn't need a girlfriend and that it's futile to try to find the "bra matching the panties", and Matthew accuses him of being too macho.
Rod introduces Matthew to the "penile power", which involves the use of weights attached to his penis as a means of increasing the organ's size.
He does this and insults women to make himself feel better about the problem he has with his manhood; he suffers from hypospadias.
Early on, Matthew watches as a woman named Patty (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her boyfriend Crick (Johnny Green) fight.
Crick is the epitome of the macho man stereotype, with his big pectorals, conceited attitude, and abusiveness.
He wears a ponytail, a manicured goatee, "male make-up", and chews nicotine gum, much to Matthew's dismay.
Matthew tries to save Patty, but is hurt by Crick.
Crick leaves, and Patty tries to help Matthew, but Matthew can't help but think of Patty's reputation as a "slut".
While searching one room, Matthew finds himself trapped in the bathroom when the occupant returns.
Matthew is attacked by Wendy (Larisa Oleynik), until she recognizes him as a high school classmate.
Wendy decides to help Matthew in his quest to find his mystery maiden, hoping that, in the process, she may find one of her own, as she is a closeted lesbian.
Matthew is nervous about talking to girls.
Arlene (Katherine Heigl) and his teacher ms Stern (Aimee Graham) disparage Matthew, asserting that women are more dominant than men are.
Arlene beats him at foosball.
ms Stern asserts that women, rather than men, should be in command.
Rod tells Matthew that he's a chicken and should just give up on girls, while Matthew tells him that he has never been able to speak to girls, especially Cynthia (Jaime Pressly).
Matthew puts an advertisement in the school newspaper asking the girl he's seeking to meet him in the basement on a Thursday night.
He sits in the dark every Thursday night, waiting for her to show up.
The door opens one night, and he thinks it's her, but it's Wendy, coming to check up on him.
Finally, the mystery maiden does show up, only to tell him to stop looking for her.
Despite the approach of the end of the semester, Matthew isn't deterred.
He disguises himself in drag, as Francesca, as a means to continue his search.
In drag, he is actually able to talk to Cynthia one on one which, (until she is injured later on), he is not able to do because he is intimidated by her good looks.
Rod flirts with Francesca and later brags to Matthew that he had sex with Francesca.
This makes Matthew so angry that he adds another weight onto Rod's "penile power" device, hurting him.
Crick makes a pass at Matthew in drag while he fights with Patty.
Matthew bites off part of Crick's tongue.
As a result, Crick is unable to speak without lisping.
Desperation sets in, so Matthew appeals to his mystery maiden by proclaiming his love for her to the whole dormitory.
He finally determines his mystery maiden is Patty.
She initially rejects him because she thought that he would see her only as a slut.
Crick sees that Matthew wants Patty, but Matthew has him arrested for sexually assaulting him (when he was dressed as Francesca).
Matthew introduces Rod and Dora, and Arlene and Wendy hook up.
Cynthia shows off her newly found martial art abilities, and ms Stern learns a valuable lesson on gender equality, as Matthew stands up to her in front of the class, to an ovation.
Finally, Matthew proclaims his passionate love to Patty, who sees his loving eyes, and they kiss.

Pushing Tin

Nick "The Zone" Falzone (John Cusack) and his fellow air traffic controllers at New York TRACON pride themselves on their ability to handle the intense stress of being a controller for one of the busiest airspaces in the country, even boasting of the 50% drop-out rate for new additions to the staff who are unable to cope with the pressure.
The group is joined by the quiet and confident Russell Bell (Billy Bob Thornton), a veteran of TRACONs in the Western United States.
Russell quickly proves to be exceptionally capable of handling the increased workload by using unorthodox and risky methods.
Nick feels challenged by the new controller's ability to out-perform him at seemingly every task and warns his supervisor that Bell is a loose cannon, especially after discovering that Russell once stood on a runway to allow himself to be violently propelled by a landing commercial airliner's jetwash.
At a supermarket, Nick encounters Russell's despondent young wife Mary (Angelina Jolie), who is sobbing over a grocery cart full of alcohol.
In consoling her, Nick ends up back at the Bells' house, where he and Mary both cheat on their respective spouses by having sex.
Several days later, Mary informs Nick that she immediately told Russell about the affair, and that the confession has actually improved their marriage.
Fearing retaliation, Nick confronts Russell at work, and is confused and surprised by Russell's even-tempered response to the situation.
Meanwhile, Nick's wife, Connie (Cate Blanchett), seems to become more and more intrigued by Russell, and Nick becomes increasingly paranoid that Russell will eventually seek revenge by having sex with her.
While out of town for his father-in-law's funeral, Nick can't bring himself to lie when a grieving Connie challenges him to say that he has never cheated on her.
As their flight home approaches New York, Connie tells Nick that she has indeed slept with Russell.
The plane then makes an odd turn, and Nick assumes that Russell is harassing him, or possibly going insane, by purposely directing the plane into a dangerous storm.
Soon after going to TRACON to confront Russell, a bomb threat is called in to the facility.
The building is evacuated as both Nick and Russell volunteer to stay behind to handle the daunting task of landing all the planes on approach in their airspace before the alleged bomb is set to go off in 26 minutes.
Successfully routing all but one plane that has lost radio contact, Nick leaves the building as the deadline approaches, while Russell instead remains inside to make contact with the plane by calling one of its passengers via Airfone.
Russell is lauded as a hero for making the effort despite the threat, which turned out to be a hoax.
Russell abruptly quits and he and Mary move to Colorado.
Connie leaves Nick, and his performance at work suffers; the once cocky, boastful controller is sent home after being responsible for two deals (near mid-air collisions) in one shift.
After learning that Russell had ordered the diversion of Nick's flight not to provoke him, but to clear a path to make a plane with a medical emergency on board next in line for a landing, Nick impulsively drives out to Colorado to make amends with Russell.
Nick seeks his advice on how to get his personal life back in order, but Russell is unable to make Nick understand with words.
He instead brings Nick to a runway so that he too can experience being caught in a landing aircraft's turbulence.
The two engage in the stunt together, and it has a profound effect on Nick, who thanks Russell.
He returns to New York, where he regains his form at work, and reconciles with Connie.

Fed up with her dead-end job with a Minneapolis car rental agency, Martha quits, cashes her final paycheck, and uses the money to purchase an airline ticket to the least expensive international destination she can find - London.
At the airport, she meets Daniel, a successful music label executive, who covertly arranges for her to be upgraded to First Class and seated next to him on the flight.
When she sells the ticket to another passenger and Daniel finds his seatmate is an obnoxiously loud woman instead of the girl of his dreams, he moves back to the Economy section and takes the vacant seat next to Martha.

My Beautiful Laundrette

Omar Ali is a young man living in Battersea in the Wandsworth area of South London, right by the railway station during the mid-1980s.
His father, Hussein (known to the rest of the family as Papa), once a famous left-wing British Pakistani journalist in Bombay, lives in London but hates Britain's society and its international politics.
His dissatisfaction with the world and a family tragedy have led him to sink into alcoholism, so that Omar has to be his caregiver.
By contrast, Omar's paternal uncle Nasser is a successful entrepreneur and an active member of the London Pakistani community.
Papa asks Nasser to give Omar a job and, after working for a brief time as a car washer in one of his uncle's garages, he is assigned the task of managing a run-down laundrette and turning it into a profitable business.
At Nasser's, Omar meets a few other members of the Pakistani community: Tania, Nasser's daughter and possibly a future bride; and Salim, who trafficks drugs and hires him to deliver them from the airport.
While driving Salim and his wife home that night, the three of them get attacked by a group of right-wing extremist street punks.
Their apparent leader turns out to be Johnny, Omar's childhood friend.
Omar tries to reestablish their past friendship, offering Johnny a job and the opportunity to adopt a better life by working to fix up the laundrette with him.
Johnny decides to help with the laundrette and they resume a romantic relationship that (it is implied) had been interrupted after school.
Running out of money, Omar and Johnny sell one of Salim's drug deliveries to make cash for the laundrette's substantial renovation.
On the opening day of the laundrette, Omar confronts Johnny on his fascist past.
Johnny, feeling guilty, tells him that though he cannot make it up to him, he is with him now.
Nasser visits the laundrette with his mistress, Rachel.
As they dance together in the laundrette, Omar and Johnny make love in the back room, narrowly escaping discovery.
At the inauguration, Tania confronts Rachel about having an affair with her father.
Rachel accuses Nasser of having invited Tania on purpose to have her insulted, and storms off despite his protests.
Later that night, a drunk Omar proposes to Tania, who accepts on the condition that he raise money to get away.
Soon after, Salim reveals to Omar that he is on to them, and demands his money back.
Omar's father stops by late in the night and appeals to Johnny to persuade Omar to go to college because he is unhappy with his son running a laundrette.
Offering Salim a chance to invest in his businesses as a much needed 'clean outlet' for his money, Omar decides to take over two laundrettes owned by a friend of Nasser.
Salim drives Johnny and Omar to view one of the properties, and he expresses his dislike of the British non-working punks in Johnny's gang.
He attempts to run them over and injures one of them.
Meanwhile, Rachel falls ill with a skin rash apparently caused by a ritual curse from Nasser's wife, and decides it is best for all that she and Nasser part ways.
The next day Tania drops by the laundrette and tells Johnny she is leaving, asking him to come along.
He refuses, implicitly revealing the truth about himself and Omar and she departs wordlessly.
After Salim arrives and enters the laundrette, the punks, who had been lying in wait, trash his car.
When he runs out on noticing them, he is ambushed and viciously attacked.
Johnny decides to interrupt and defend him, despite their mutual dislike, and the punks turn their attention to him instead.
As he refuses to fight back, they beat him savagely until Omar returns and intervenes, protecting Johnny as the punks trash the laundrette and flee the scene.
Nasser visits Papa, and the two discuss their respective failures, agreeing between them that only Omar's future matters now.
Nasser sees Tania at the train platform while she is running away, and he shouts to her but she disappears.
Meanwhile, at the laundrette, Omar nurses Johnny, and the two bond.
The film ends with a scene of them shirtless, playfully splashing each other with water from a sink, implying that they are continuing their relationship together.

Corpse Bride

In an unspecified Victorian-era village somewhere in Europe, Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp), the son of nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), the neglected daughter of hateful aristocrats, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family.
Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other.
After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows and is scolded by Pastor Galswells (Christopher Lee), he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root.
The root turns out to be the finger of a murdered woman in a tattered bridal gown named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife.
After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds out he was spirited away to the surprisingly festive Land of the Dead.
The bewildered Victor learns the story of how Emily, his new bride, was murdered years ago by an unknown criminal on the night of her secret elopement.
Emily, as a wedding gift, reunites Victor with his long-dead dog, Scraps.
Meanwhile, Victoria's parents hear that Victor has been seen in another woman's arms, and become suspicious.
Wanting to reunite with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking him back to the Land of the Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents.
She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht (Michael Gough), the kindly ruler of the underworld, to send him and Emily temporarily to the Land of the Living.
Once back home, Victor asks Emily to wait in the forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings.
Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together and, feeling betrayed and hurt, angrily drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead.
Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but they believe she has lost her mind and lock her up in her bedroom.
She escapes her room by window and rushes to Galswells to find a way to help Victor, but fails.
With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard Grant), who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.
Emily is heartbroken by Victor's deception.
Victor, however, apologizes for lying to her, and the two reconcile while playing the piano together.
Shortly after, Victor's recently deceased family coachman, Mayhew appears in the afterlife and informs Victor of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis.
In order for Victor and Emily's marriage to become valid, Victor must repeat his vows in the Land of the Living and willingly drink the Wine of Ages, a poison - thus joining her in death.
Overhearing this, and fretting about having lost Victoria to another man, Victor agrees to die for Emily.
All of the dead go "upstairs" to the Land of the Living to perform the wedding ceremony for Victor and Emily.
Upon their arrival, the town erupts into a temporary panic until everyone recognizes their loved ones from the dead and they have a joyous reunion under the bizarre circumstances.
After a quarrel with Barkis (and realizing he was only after her supposed money), Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church.
Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness the same way it was stolen from her.
As Victor prepares to drink the cup of poison to kill himself, Emily stops him and reunites him with Victoria.
Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance - who is revealed to be the one who murdered her for her dowry.
Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel.
The dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living.
Emily intercedes to save Victor and Barkis mockingly proposes a toast to Emily, claiming she was "always the bridesmaid, never the bride".
He unknowingly drinks the cup of poison.
The dead, now able to intercede, happily drag the "new arrival" back to the Land of the Dead for retribution for his crimes.
Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.
Emily sets Victor free of his vow to marry her, giving the wedding ring back to Victor and her wedding bouquet to Victoria before exiting the church.
As she steps into the moonlight, she transforms into hundreds of butterflies, presumably finding peace, as Victor and Victoria look on wrapped in each other's embrace.

Fun and Fancy Free

Jiminy Cricket first appears inside a large plant in a large house, exploring and singing "I'm a Happy-go-Lucky Fellow", until he happens to stumble upon a doll, a teddy bear, and a record player with some records, one of which is Bongo, a musical romance story narrated by actress Dinah Shore.
Jiminy decides to set up the record player to play the story of Bongo.
The story follows the adventures of a circus bear named Bongo who wishes he could live freely in the wild.
Bongo is raised in captivity and is praised for his performances, but is poorly treated once he is off stage.
As such, while traveling by a circus train his natural instincts urge him to break free.
As soon as he escapes and enters a forest, a day passes before his idealistic assessment of his new living situation has been emotionally shattered and he experiences some hard conditions.
The next morning however, he meets a female bear named Lulubelle.
The two fall in love, until Bongo immediately faces a romantic rival in the brutish, enormously-shaped bear named Lumpjaw.
Bongo fails to interpret Lulubelle slapping him as a sign of affection and when she accidentally slaps Lumpjaw, he claims her for himself, forcing all other bears into a celebration for the "happy" new couple.
Bongo comes to understand the meaning of slapping one another among wild bears and returns to challenge Lumpjaw.
He manages to outwit Lumpjaw for much of their fight until the two fall into a river and go over a waterfall.
While Lumpjaw is swept away and dies, Bongo's hat saves him from falling down and he finally can claim Lulubelle as his mate.
Bongo later aired as an individual episode on a 1955 episode of Walt Disney's anthology TV series with new introductory segments, which used Jiminy Cricket's narration and singing replacing Dinah Shore's.
The short was released separately in 1989 in the Walt Disney Mini-Classics line.
This segment is narrated by Edgar Bergen in live-action sequences, who, with the help of his ventriloquist dummies Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd, tells the tale to child actress Luana Patten at her birthday party.
The short later aired as an individual episode on a 1963 episode of Walt Disney's anthology TV series with new introductory segments.
Ludwig Von Drake (voiced by Paul Frees) replaces Edgar Bergen as the narrator in the 1963 version, for which he has a Bootle-Beetle companion named Herman (replacing the sassy comments of Edgar Bergen's ventriloquist dummy Charlie McCarthy).
A second version of the short was produced replacing Bergen with narration by Sterling Holloway, as a stand-alone short in such venues as the 1980s TV show, Good Morning, Mickey.
This short was one of many featured in Donald Duck's 50th Birthday.
A third version of Mickey and the Beanstalk was on the Disney television show "The Mouse Factory", which aired from 1972 to 1974.
This version starred Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop.
The Ludwig Von Drake version of Mickey and the Beanstalk was released separately in 1988 in the Walt Disney Mini-Classics line.
This version was then re-released in 1994, as part of Disney Favorite Stories collection.
In 2004, the theatrical version of Mickey and the Beanstalk was released as a bonus feature on the Walt Disney Treasures set Mickey Mouse In Living Color, Volume Two.
The TV version, featuring Ludwig Von Drake narrating, is available as part of the (Volume 1).
A jovial countryside land called Happy Valley, kept alive at all times by a singing harp, is suddenly plagued by a severe drought and falls into turmoil and depression after the harp is stolen from the castle by a mysterious assailant (and also nicknamed "Gruesome Gulch").
The residents are driven into poverty and forced to leave in order to avoid death by starvation.
Eventually, only three residents are left: Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.
The trio have but just one loaf of bread and a single solitary bean to eat.
One particular night, Mickey is forced to cut the bread into slices so ridiculously paper-thin that you could see right through them.
Donald, driven to insanity by starvation, attempts to kill their pet cow with an axe, but is stopped by the combined efforts of Mickey and Goofy.
Mickey then decides to sell the cow for money to buy food.
Goofy and Donald are excited about eating again and begin to sing about delicious dishes until Mickey comes back and reveals that he traded their beloved bovine for a container of beans, which he claims to be magical.
An enraged Donald, thinking that Mickey had been tricked, furiously throws the beans down the floor and they fall through a hole.
However, it turns out that the beans are truly magical after all as later that night, the light of a full moon causes a beanstalk to sprout from under the house and lift it far up into the sky.
The next morning, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy climb the gigantic beanstalk and enter a magical kingdom of enormous scope, where they appear to be tiny creatures compared to their surroundings.
They eventually make their way to a huge castle, where they help themselves to a sumptuous feast.
There they stumble across the harp locked in a small box, as she explains that she was kidnapped by a "wicked giant".
Sure enough, just then, a giant named Willie emerges from the shadows, grunting angrily but then suddenly breaking into a happy song ("Fee Fi Fo Fum") and bouncing a ball about while demonstrating rather amazing powers like flight, invisibility, and shapeshifting.
As Willie prepares to eat lunch, he accidentally catches Mickey in his sandwich.
Mickey sneezes when Willie pours pepper and tries to run away, but Willie catches him.
Mickey plays palm reader and gains the childish giant's trust.
Willie offers to show off his powers, and Mickey, spotting a nearby fly-swatter, asks him to change into a fly.
However, Willie suggests turning into a pink bunny instead, and as he does he sees Mickey, Donald, and Goofy with the fly-swatter.
Angry, Willie captures Mickey, Donald, and Goofy and locks them in the harp's chest so as to keep them from pulling any more tricks.
In order to escape, Mickey must find the key and rescue his friends, and does so with the help of the singing golden harp, who begins singing Willie to sleep.
Mickey almost alerts Willie to his presence by sneezing after falling into a box of powder in Willie's pocket, but the same powder makes Willie sneeze and he loses sight of Mickey.
Mickey frees his friends and they make a break for it with the harp.
However, Willie wakes up from his sleep and spots them, giving chase all the way to the beanstalk.
Mickey stalls him long enough for Donald and Goofy to reach the bottom and begin sawing the beanstalk.
Mickey arrives just in time to finish the job of cutting down the beanstalk, and Willie, who was climbing down, falls to his apparent death.
Back in the narrator's home, the narrator (be it Ludwig Von Drake or Edgar Bergen) finishes his story and cheers up his companion (be it Herman or Mortimer Snerd), who was crying for Willie.
Just as the narrator says that Willie is a fictional character and not real, Willie himself appears, alive and well, tearing the roof off the narrator's house.
Willie inquires about Mickey's whereabouts, but the narrator faints in shock while the companion tells Willie goodnight.
Before the scene closes, Willie notices The Brown Derby restaurant and picks up the building searching for any sign of Mickey and since the restaurant looks like a hat, places it on his head, and stomps off with the HOLLYWOOD lights blinking in the background.

Convinced that they came through, Showboat pays what he owed them just as Sex as a Weapon arrives.
They tell Play that they didn't like what was done to the three blind rappers earlier in the film (they were stiffed on the pay for a show) so they opted to come back to Kid & Play giving Showboat two new acts instead of just one.
Showboat again pays up, and this time the cash was taken by Aunt Lucy who informed all that the money was just enough to clean her house.
The movie ends on Kid and Veda's marriage and Kid's Uncle Vester finding a woman of his own.

A distressed Emily swears off taking in any more tramps, to the delight of the rest of the family.
However, later in the morning, Wade Rawlins (Brian Aherne) appears at the doorstep.

She's Having a Baby

This film is an existential look at the lives of Jefferson (Jake) played by Kevin Bacon and Kristy Briggs, played by Elizabeth McGovern , from their wedding day until the birth of their first child.
Beginning on their wedding day, it follows both their lives, but more so Jake's, with his voice-over commentaries and several imaginary scenes, based on actual or feared future events.
Jake asks his best friend, Davis McDonald, played by Alec Baldwin before the wedding if he thinks he'll be happy, to which his friend says, "Yeah, you'll be happy.
You just won't know it".
And this is the underlying theme of the movie, Jake's existential crisis of, "Is this all there is.
Is this really my life.
"   After their wedding, Jake and Kristy head off for New Mexico, where Jake works towards gaining a Master's degree, but leaves before finishing, describing it as, "high school with ashtrays".
They return to Chicago where Jake, by, "setting new records for lying in the job market," impresses his potential employers so much that they give him work as an advertising copywriter.
Jake wants to be a writer and tells his bosses that, which amuses and threatens one boss, who himself had failed at ever writing a book.
Kristy also gains work as a research analyst, and they are able to buy a "three-bedroom mortgage" in the suburbs.
Jake's best friend suddenly visits after not seeing him for two years, which causes the two to both envy one another's lives, and to also reaffirm their own.
Jake begins fantasizing about having an affair with a mysterious young French Model, who is wise beyond Jake's years.
Jake and Kristy then continue to adjust to their new live until Kristy unilaterally decides to cease taking contraceptives, without telling Jake, until, after several months, she informs him that he has been unable to impregnate her.
Kristy knows who she is and what she wants in life and seemingly always has.
Jake feels pressure, from society and from his wife, to have a child.
He doesn't know what he wants.
Jake and Kristy then begin a program to assist their efforts to become pregnant, which eventually succeed.
The movie culminates with a traumatic yet eventually successful labor and Jake's realization that his lack of satisfaction and sense of detachment are not due to external factors but his own selfishness and immaturity.
The last scene of the film reveals that Jake's voice-over was the new father reading his novel entitled She's Having a Baby to his wife and son.
As the credits roll, there is a rapid succession of suggestions for the name of the baby by numerous cameos including Roy Orbison, Joanna Kerns, Magic Johnson, Ted Danson, Woody Harrelson, Wil Wheaton, Belinda Carlisle and Kirstie Alley.
John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, and Matthew Broderick were in character as Chet Ripley, Roman Craig, and Ferris Bueller during the end credits.

Grosse Pointe Blank

Professional assassin Martin Blank finds himself depressed and bored with his work.
A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds as he is unaffiliated.
Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan.
Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, dr Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella.
She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched.
Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his childhood friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army.
When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets.
Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home.
He is also pursued by two NSA agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer.
Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to woo Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target.
At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler.
Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good.
Moments later, while exploring the halls, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense.
Debi stumbles upon the scene and, horrified to find that Martin was not joking about his work after all, flees the reunion.
Paul arrives only moments later to find Martin, who coerces him into helping dispose of LaPoubelle's body in the school furnace.
Realizing that his friend was not joking about his profession, Paul has a drink and leaves the dance.
Later Debi confronts Martin in his hotel room, where he reveals that psychological testing in the army showed he was suited to work as a hitman for the CIA; after leaving the CIA, he went into business for himself.
His rationalizations for his work only scare Debi even more; she rejects his attempts at reconciliation and storms out.
Martin, concluding that it is futile to try to change his life, fires his psychiatrist over the phone, notifies Marcella that he is laying her off (but directs her to a brick of cash hidden in the office, set aside for her severance pay) and finally opens the dossier containing the details of the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe.
He is startled to find that the target is Debi's father, Bart, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's client.
Grocer decides to kill Bart himself to impress Martin's client.
Martin abandons the contract and rescues Bart from certain death, driving him to the Newberry house and holing up inside, narrowly ahead of Grocer and his mercenaries.
During the siege, Martin finally reveals that he stood Debi up on prom night to enlist in the army to protect her from his homicidal urges.
Martin gradually kills the team of mercenaries.
The NSA agents are gunned down by Grocer and Martin.
By this point, Martin has run out of ammunition, and when Grocer tries to trick him into "selling" him a weapon for $100,000, Martin kills him by crushing his head with a television.
Injured and winded, Martin proposes marriage to Debi, who, shell-shocked from the day's events, does not respond.
In the end, Debi and Martin leave Grosse Pointe together.

She's Gotta Have It

Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns) is a young, attractive, sexually independent Brooklynite who juggles three suitors: the polite and well-meaning Jamie Overstreet (Tommy Redmond Hicks); the self-obsessed model Greer Childs (John Canada Terrell); and the immature, motor-mouthed Mars Blackmon (Spike Lee).
Nola is attracted to the best in each of them, but refuses to commit to any of them, cherishing her personal freedom instead, while each man wants her for himself.
Her carefree sexually liberated lifestyle ultimately comes to an end when her three male suitors meet and compare notes on Nola.
While Greer justifies Nola's callous behavior by claiming that she sees the three not as individuals but as a collective, Jamie and Mars become bitter over how little Nola cares for all three men.
Realizing that Mars and Greer are too scared of losing Nola to force her to choose one of the three men, Jamie lays down an ultimatum to her that she must choose a single lover.
Nola scoffs at this decision, and visits him several days later at his apartment for casual sex.
Jamie rapes Nola, while mockingly asking her if he's as good sexually, as Greer or Mars.
Being raped causes Nola to have an epiphany: realizing that promiscuity has turned Jamie against her, she decides to call Jamie's bluff.
Nola dumps Greer and Mars and then tells Jamie that she's is ready for a monogamous relationship.
However, there is a catch: Nola, believing that her promiscuity is the source of her inability to commit to a single guy, wants the relationship to be celibate for the time being.
Though he at first rejects Nola's "no sex" decree, Jamie agrees to it after initially saying no.
Nola and Jamie's reunion however, is followed by a coda which dismantles the "happy ending" of the couple coming together.
In a monologue delivered to the camera Nola reveals that her vow of celibacy and her decision to be with Jamie exclusively was "a moment of weakness".
Nola explains that she soon began to cheat on Jamie and ultimately the relationship collapsed, though she is vague on specifics or whether or not she resumed her casual affairs with Mars or Greer (the latter of which vowed never to have anything else to do with Nola after being dumped).
Nola proudly proclaims that monogamy was a form of slavery and that her promiscuous lifestyle is freedom in its purest form.
However, the film implies that Nola is still terminally unhappy with her decision to leave Jamie as the film closes with Nola going to bed all alone.

My Sassy Girl

The film tells the love story of a male engineering college student, Gyeon-woo, and "the Girl" (who is never named in the movie).
Gyeon-woo just cannot seem to catch a romantic break.
One day, at dinner, Gyeon-woo is interrupted by a call from his mother, telling him to visit his aunt and meet a potential date.
At the train station on his way to his aunt's, he observes a drunk girl, standing precariously close to the edge of the train platform as the train approaches; he pulls her to safety just in time.
Inside the train, Gyeon-woo cannot help but stare at the girl who is his "type" but repulsed by her drunkenness.
Finally, she throws up on a passenger and faints but not before she calls Gyeon-woo "honey".
The passenger aggressively chides Gyeon-woo and tells him to take care of his "girlfriend".
Gyeon-woo, completely flustered, carries her all the way to the nearest hotel.
Thus begins his comically ill-fated relationship with the Girl.
They meet each other again after Gyeon-woo gets locked up in jail over a misunderstanding, and over soju the Girl cries, admits to breaking up with her boyfriend the day before and gets thoroughly drunk, resulting in a second trip to the same hotel.
After this second overnight stay at the hotel, she begins to become a more active part of his life.
She visits Gyeon-woo in school and pulls him out of class, telling the teacher that Gyeon-woo is the father of her soon-to-be-aborted baby.
The Girl's mood swings wildly from joyful to downright violent, but Gyeon-woo puts up with it and lets her abuse him for her amusement.
She is an aspiring scriptwriter and throughout the movie gives Gyeon-woo three different screenplays from different genres.
The first is an action movie—The Demolition Terminator—which switches gender roles, symbolically having the Girl save her helpless lover (Gyeon-woo).
The second is a wild perversion of a Korean short story—Sonagi—in which the Girl, having died, asks that her lover be buried along with her—even though he's still alive.
The last is a wuxia/samurai movie spoof full of genre clichés and anachronisms.
All three feature the same common thread: the Girl is from the future.
Despite all the horrible things Gyeon-woo endures, he is determined to help cure the girl's pain.
He decides to surprise her on her birthday and takes her on a nighttime trip to an amusement park which ends up quite differently from how he planned: the pair encounter an AWOL soldier who holds them hostage and rants about his misery after being jilted.
Gyeon-woo convinces him to release her, and she in turn convinces the soldier to free Gyeon-woo and go on with his life and pursue another love.
The Girl and Gyeon-woo's relationship takes a turn for the better and he sends her home and meets her father, who is a habitual drinker.
Her parents do not take to Gyeon-woo and on leaving, he overhears an impassioned argument between the girl and her mother over her relationship with him.
He does not hear from her for quite some time and his life without her begins.
One day however, the Girl calls him and tells him to bring her a rose during class to commemorate their 100th-day anniversary.
He does this, leading to a touching and romantic scene where he arrives in disguise into a packed auditorium and watches her play the melody of George Winston's variations on Pachelbel's Canon in D on a piano onstage.
The classmates applaud in approval at his romantic gesture.
As the night unfolds he is confronted at her house by her parents again, with her father demanding the two to break up.
The Girl does not contact him again and Gyeon-woo naturally thinks they have broken up, until one day when she calls Gyeon-woo to meet her for dinner with a blind date.
The Girl introduces Gyeon-woo to the date and, while she leaves for the washroom afterwards, Gyeon-woo candidly offers advice on how to ensure her happiness by asking her potential suitor to follow ten rules: preventing her from overdrinking and giving in to her at every circumstance, even if it means enduring the occasional "violence".
It is at this point that she realizes how well Gyeon-woo understands her.
She abruptly leaves her date and searches for Gyeon-woo at the subway station.
Once reunited the two realize they are at a turning point in their relationship, but, for some unspeakable reason, the Girl decides it is time for them to part.
As a gesture to their happy times the two write letters to each other and bury them in a "time capsule" under a particular tree on a mountain in the countryside.
They agree to meet again at the tree after two years to read the letters together.
After burying the "time capsule" they go their separate ways.
During the two-year span, Gyeon-woo works hard to improve himself, writing My Sassy Girl movie script after he details their love affair on the Internet.
When the agreed upon date arrives, he travels to the mountain but the Girl does not show up.
Eventually, he opens the time capsule and reads her letter and learns the root of her angst and behavior: Gyeon-woo reminds her of her previous boyfriend who, rather than breaking up with her, actually died before she met Gyeon-woo.
All through the time the Girl and Gyeon-woo were seeing each other she had been seeing her dead boyfriend's mother, who wants to introduce her to a nice young man.
A year after Gyeon-woo visits the tree, the Girl finally arrives.
Sitting under the tree is an old man.
During their conversation the old man reveals the secret of the tree, that it is not the same tree; the original tree had been struck and killed by lightning a year before and a similar tree had been planted by a young man so that his special someone would not be sad.
After the girl reads his letter, she tries to call Gyeon-woo repeatedly, but is unable to contact him.
At lunch with her deceased boyfriend's mother after a year later, the mother introduces her nephew—who turns out to be Gyeon-woo, whom she has been trying to introduce to the Girl for years.
The mother, who is Gyeon-woo's aunt, tells the Girl to go out with him, hoping that he could make life easier for her.
She tells Gyeon-woo that the Girl can give advice to him about his impending trip to England, to which he replies, "I don't have to go anymore".

You're a Big Boy Now

Bernard Chanticleer (Peter Kastner), called "Big Boy" by his parents, is 19 but still lives with his overbearing, clinging mother (Geraldine Page) and his commanding, disapproving father (Rip Torn), who is Curator of Incunabula at the New York Public Library.
Bernard also works as a low-level assistant at the library, where his father is constantly monitoring and admonishing him.
His father decides it's time he grew up and moved out of the family home in Great Neck and into his own Manhattan apartment.
His mother is not happy about letting him go, but acquiesces to her husband and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing (Julie Harris).
Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room.
Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks girls, especially young pretty girls, to which Bernard's mother responds that her son isn't interested in girls yet, but arranges that Miss Thing will spy on Bernard and report any "female" activity.
Bernard's mother also constantly mails locks of her hair to Bernard at his new residence.
Actually, Bernard is very interested in girls, but due to his upbringing he's a naive, immature virgin.
He is smitten from afar with the coldly beautiful actress Barbara Darling (Elizabeth Hartman).
Meanwhile, Amy Partlett (Karen Black), Bernard's grade school classmate who now works in his father's office, confesses to Bernard that she has a crush on him.
Bernard's worldly co-worker Raef Del Grado (Tony Bill) encourages him to date Amy because she's a "sure thing"— a girl that will sleep with him — but discourages him from trying to pursue Barbara.
Amy and Bernard go on a date to a discotheque, but when Bernard sees Barbara performing as the featured go-go dancer, he is mesmerized by Barbara and loses all interest in Amy.
Amy tries to win him back by kissing him and offering to spend the night with him, which Bernard accepts although he's thinking of Barbara the entire time.
When they try to go to Bernard's room, the rooster attacks Amy, causing a commotion in which Miss Thing falls down the stairs and breaks her arm.
Bernard's mother blames Amy, calling her a tramp and forbidding Bernard from seeing her again.
Bernard writes Barbara a gushing fan letter, to which she responds inviting him to visit her at the theater where she's appearing in a play.
Barbara is a narcissist, who hates men after being sexually assaulted as a young girl by an albino one-legged hypnotherapist.
Not knowing all this, Bernard is thrilled to hear from her, rushes to the theater to meet her, and bumbles his way through an evening at her apartment.
Barbara, enjoying her control over Bernard's emotions, teases him and later tries to seduce him, but he can't perform and is upset about it though Barbara seems to be understanding and even invites him to move in with her.
Meanwhile, Amy has been calling Bernard's rooming house all night looking for him.
Miss Thing goes to the library to tell Bernard's father that Bernard was out all night and a girl called him every 15 minutes.
Miss Thing and Bernard's father accidentally get trapped in a timelocked vault full of rare erotica, which horrifies her and causes her to rush out in disarray when the vault opens, giving the impression that Bernard's father made a pass at her.
Bernard's father has also made a pass at Amy, who gets upset and tells Bernard.
Miss Thing evicts Bernard, so he moves in with Barbara, although he still can't perform with her and she's starting to treat him badly.
His parents have wrongly concluded he's spending nights with Amy, but when they discover Amy hasn't seen him, his father sends Raef to find him, leading to Raef and Barbara becoming engaged and Barbara throwing Bernard out of her apartment.
Bernard, followed by Raef and Barbara, returns to the library where his parents and Amy are waiting for him.
Miss Thing and her new boyfriend, police officer Francis Graf (Dolph Sweet), who also lives in her boarding house, also arrive to confront Bernard's father about what happened in the vault.
Bernard finally rebels against his parents, telling them he's leaving and wants to get away from them, and then grabbing and running away with his father's most prized library item, the Gutenberg Bible.
A slapstick chase through a street parade and a department store follows, ending when Barbara knocks Bernard out with a mannequin's leg.
Barbara is featured in the newspaper for stopping a rare book thief and saving the Gutenberg Bible for the City of New York.
Elated with her newfound fame, Barbara dumps Raef.
Bernard is jailed, but Amy bails him out and he realizes she's the girl for him, and they go off happily together.

Intolerable Cruelty

Donovan Donaly (Geoffrey Rush) a TV soap opera producer, surprises his wife Bonnie (Stacey Travis) being intimate with an ex-boyfriend.
He files for divorce, and Bonnie hires Miles Massey (George Clooney), a top divorce attorney and the inventor of the "Massey pre-nup", a completely foolproof prenuptial agreement.
Miles wins a large property settlement against Donaly, leaving him broke.
Private investigator Gus Petch (Cedric the Entertainer) tails the wealthy and married Rex Rexroth (Edward Herrmann) on a drunken night out with a blonde.
When they stop at a motel, Gus catches their tryst on video.
He takes the video to Rex's wife, Marylin Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a marriage-for-money predator.
She files for divorce, demanding a large property settlement.
Unable to afford a divorce settlement, Rex hires Miles to represent him.
Marylin's friend, serial divorcée Sarah Sorkin (Julia Duffy), warns Marilyn that Miles will be a dangerous opponent.
Marylin and her lawyer, Freddy Bender (Richard Jenkins), fail to reach an agreement with Miles and Rex.
Bored Miles asks the fascinating Marylin to dinner, where they flirt.
While they are out, Petch breaks in and copies her address book for Miles, who has his assistant search among the names for Marylin's accomplice in predatory marriage.
In court, Marylin feigns an emotional breakdown over Rex's infidelity, professing that she loved Rex unconditionally at first sight.
Miles then calls "Puffy" Krauss von Espy (Jonathan Hadary), a Swiss hotel concierge located by his assistant.
Puffy testifies that Marylin asked him to find her a marriage target who was very rich, foolish, and a philanderer whom she could easily divorce, and that he pointed her to Rex.
The divorce is granted, but Marylin gets nothing, and Miles' ancient boss, Herb Myerson (Tom Aldredge), congratulates him.
Marylin wants revenge.
She finds the now-penniless Donaly living on the street, still clutching his Emmy statuette.
She offers him a chance to reclaim his lost glory if he helps her get revenge on Miles.
Soon after, Marylin shows up at Miles' office with her new fiancé, oil millionaire Howard Doyle (Billy Bob Thornton).
Marylin insists on the Massey prenup, which will make it absolutely impossible for her to claim any of her fiancée's assets in the event of a divorce, over both Howard and Miles's objections.
However, Howard destroys it during the wedding, as a demonstration of love.
Six months later, Miles goes to Las Vegas to give the keynote address at a convention for divorce attorneys.
He encounters Marylin, who has divorced Howard and presumably collected a sizable share of the Doyle Oil fortune.
However, she admits that she is disenchanted with her wealthy but lonely life.
Miles is thrilled, and marries her on the spur of the moment.
To prove that he has no interest in her fortune, he signs the Massey prenup, but she tears it up.
The next morning a disheveled Miles tells the convention that love is the most important thing, and that he is giving up divorce for pro bono work.
A short time later, Miles discovers that "Howard Doyle" was just an actor from one of Donaly's soap operas.
Marylin has tricked him, and now his considerable wealth is at risk.
Miles' boss demands that something be done to save the firm's reputation, and suggests the hitman "Wheezy Joe" (Irwin Keyes).
Miles hires him to kill Marylin.
Miles then learns that Marylin's ex-husband Rex has died without changing his will, leaving her his entire fortune.
Since she is now the wealthier of the two parties, his assets are no longer at risk.
A repentant Miles rushes to save Marylin from Wheezy Joe, but Marilyn has already offered to pay him double to kill Miles instead.
There is a struggle; in the confusion Wheezy Joe mistakes his gun for his asthma inhaler, and kills himself.
Later, Miles, Marylin and their lawyers meet to negotiate a divorce.
Miles pleads for a second chance and retroactively signs a Massey prenup.
Realizing her own feelings for him, she tears it up, and they kiss.
Marylin then tells Miles that to get Donaly's help for supplying Doyle, she gave him an idea for a hit TV show, restoring his fortunes in the process: America's Funniest Divorce Videos, with Gus Petch as the host.

When the passengers disembark at the final destination of Singapore, Emily leaves with Gordon for his home.
When he reveals that the princess is a sham aiming to relieve Fred of his money, she realises she cannot go on with Gordon and returns to warn her husband.
Fred does not believe her at first, but soon discovers his lover has absconded with £1000 of his money to Rangoon.
He learns that she was merely the daughter of a Berlin laundry owner and a common street walker.
The couple have only enough money to clear their hotel bill and to book passage home to England on a tramp steamer.
However, Fred and Emily's troubles have not ended, as the ship is abandoned after a collision in the fog.
They are trapped in their cabin and prepare themselves for a watery end.
In the morning, however, they awake to find the ship still afloat, and escape through a porthole.
A Chinese junk arrives, and the crew proceed to loot the ship.
When Fred and Emily board the junk, they are left unmolested and even fed.
They finally return home, with their love for each other strengthened and seemingly wiser for their experiences.
In the last scene, back home in London, the couple are seen arguing in a manner reminiscent of their bickering immediately prior to the arrival of the fateful letter.

How to Steal a Million

Charles Bonnet (Hugh Griffith) is a highly skilled art forger who pretends to be an art collector.
His daughter Nicole (Audrey Hepburn) disapproves of his forgeries and is afraid that he may get caught.
At the beginning of the film, he lends a renowned statue of Venus, ostensibly by Cellini, to the Kléber-Lafayette Museum in Paris as the centerpiece of an important exhibition.
However, the statue was forged by Nicole's grandfather and would fail even a basic analysis as to its materials and age.
That night, while Charles is at the exhibition's opening event, Nicole hears a noise.
She finds Simon Dermott (Peter O'Toole) holding a Van Gogh that her father made recently.
Accusing him of burglary, she aims an antique gun at him and accidentally shoots him in the arm.
To avoid an investigation around the fake masterpieces, she does not call the police, but instead cleans Simon's flesh wound and drives him to his hotel.
He suddenly kisses her goodbye outside.
Soon after, Nicole has a dinner date with wealthy American tycoon, Davis Leland (Eli Wallach).
She is suspicious of Davis, believing he knows her father is an art forger.
He confesses to Nicole he is obsessed with owning the Cellini Venus, and arranged the dinner in order to convince her to sell it to him.
Relieved that he doesn't suspect anything, she kisses him and tells him that the statue is not for sale.
The next day, an employee from the museum arrives at Charles's home and asks for Charles's signature on the million-dollar insurance policy for the sculpture.
After Charles signs it, the man reveals that Charles just agreed that the Venus will undergo a technical examination the following Friday.
Desperate to save her father from being caught and sent to prison, Nicole meets with Simon, believing him to be a burglar, and asks him to steal the Venus for her.
They both examine the museum's security measures, with Simon initially indicating he does not believe it is possible to steal the Venus.
On the night of the heist, Davis shows up again at Nicole and Charles' home before Nicole can leave to meet Simon.
Davis is so in love with the Cellini and desperate to acquire it that he asks her to marry him.
Not wanting to be late, she quickly takes the ring and leaves for the museum.
Nicole and Simon hide in a utility closet until the museum closes.
After making note of how often the guards check the museum, Simon sets off the security alarm surrounding the Cellini Venus using a boomerang he had bought at the park a few days before.
The guards and police rush in and check the museum, but upon finding that nothing is missing, they soon leave and reset the alarm.
Simon reveals that he knows that Nicole wants the statue stolen because of the technical examination the next day, and suspected that the statue was a fake because it resembled Nicole (it was modeled after her grandmother).
He only helped Nicole because of his feelings for her, and they kiss.
Simon then sets off the alarms again.
After realizing that nothing is missing, the frustrated guards decide the security system has malfunctioned.
Because of telephone complaints from high-ranking politicians in the area about the alarm, they turn it completely off.
Simon then steals the statue, Nicole hides it in a cleaner's bucket, and they escape through the basement in the confusion after it is discovered missing.
The next morning, after the news of the robbery has spread, Davis quickly looks for a lead on the missing statue, desperate to get to it at any cost.
He meets Simon, who says he will give the Venus to him, but that he can never mention the statue to anyone, or see Nicole again.
After Davis leaves, Nicole joins Simon at his table to celebrate the robbery.
Simon finally reveals to Nicole (who still believes him to be a professional burglar) that he is in fact a college-educated art expert and investigator hired by the world's largest galleries to strengthen security and uncover forgeries.
The Cellini Venus was, in fact, his first heist.
Later, at the steps of a private plane, Simon passes Davis the Venus.
When he opens the box, Davis also finds Nicole's engagement ring.
Simon assures Charles that the fake Venus is safely out of the country.
Charles is so relieved at the news that he's only momentarily disappointed when Simon tells him that the purchase price was, and will remain, zero dollars.
Simon and Nicole extract a promise from Charles that he will stop selling forged paintings.
Nicole and Simon get married.
As they leave the mansion, however, a South American collector who had enthusiastically admired Charles' new Van Gogh at the start of the film pulls up in a car and is warmly welcomed by the old forger.

The Purple Rose of Cairo

Set in New Jersey during the Great Depression in 1935, the film tells the story of Cecilia (Mia Farrow), a clumsy waitress who goes to the movies to escape her bleak life and loveless, abusive marriage to Monk (Danny Aiello), whom she has attempted to leave on numerous occasions.
The latest film Cecilia sees is a fictitious RKO Radio Pictures film, The Purple Rose of Cairo.
It is the story of a rich Manhattan playwright named Henry (Edward Herrmann) who goes on an exotic vacation to Egypt with companions Jason (John Wood) and Rita (Deborah Rush).
While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels).
Tom is brought back for a "madcap Manhattan weekend" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers), a chanteuse at the Copacabana.
After Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the fourth wall, and emerges from the black-and-white screen into the colorful real world on the other side of the cinema's screen.
He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town.
Later, he takes her into the film and they have a great evening on the town within the film.
The two fall in love.
But the character's defection from the film has caused some problems.
In other copies of the film, others have tried to exit the screen.
The producer of the film learns that Tom has left the film, and he flies cross-country to New Jersey with actor Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels) (the "real life" actor playing the part of Tom in the movie).
This sets up an unusual love triangle involving Tom, Gil, and Cecilia.
Cecilia must choose between them and she decides to choose the real person of Gil rather than the fantasy figure of Tom.
She gives up the chance to return with Tom to his world, choosing to stay with Gil and have a 'real' life.
Then she breaks up with her husband.
But Gil's professions of love for Cecilia were false&mdash;he wooed her only to get Tom to return to the movie and thereby save his own Hollywood career.
Gil abandons Cecilia and is seen quietly racked with guilt on his flight back to Hollywood.
Having been left without a lover, job, or home, Cecilia ends up immersing herself in the frothy escapism of Hollywood once again, sitting in a theater watching Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing to "Cheek-to-Cheek" in the film Top Hat, forgetting her dire situation and losing herself in the film.

".
Helen (who, in the beginning of the film, assumed the rejoinder to be "always look on the bright side of life".
) says, "Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition".

A Little Romance

Lauren King (Diane Lane) is a book-smart 13-year-old American girl with an IQ of 167 living in Paris with her affluent family.
She spends her free time reading Heidegger.
Daniel Michon (Thelonious Bernard) is a street-wise 13-year-old French boy who lives in La Garenne with his father, a cabbie.
He loves Hollywood films and amuses himself handicapping theoretical wagers on horse races.
The two meet in the Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte, where a movie is being filmed, and fall in love.
Lauren's self-absorbed mother (Sally Kellerman), who consorts openly with her movie director boyfriend George in front of Lauren and her stepfather (Arthur Hill), fiercely objects to the romance, calling Daniel a "filthy French boy".
When Daniel punches George at Lauren's birthday party for making a crude innuendo about Lauren, the two are forbidden to date.
Lauren and Daniel meet Julius Santorin (Laurence Olivier), a quirky but kindly gentleman, literally by accident.
He bores Daniel but fascinates Lauren with stories of his life.
Julius and Lauren share a mutual love of the poetry of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and he claims to have lived at one time in the Brownings' villa in Venice.
This leads Julius to tell of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever.
Told that her family will be returning to America soon, Lauren hatches a plan to travel to Venice with Daniel.
With the help of Julius (they cannot cross the border without an adult) and 18,000 francs won on a horse race, the three travel by train but miss their connection to Verona after Julius gets into a conversation during the stop at the Italian border.
In the meantime Lauren's family discovers she is missing and spark an international investigation, believing Lauren has been abducted.
They hitch a ride with an American couple from Columbus, Ohio, the Duryeas (Andrew Duncan and Claudette Sutherland), who are touring Italy by car and also traveling to Venice.
In Verona the travelers go out to dinner together, where Bob Duryea discovers that his wallet has been stolen.
Since their winnings from the horse race were left on the train in Julius's vest, presumably they have no money either, but Julius offers to pay the bill with cash, perplexing Lauren and irritating Daniel, who suspects he stole it.
The following morning Lauren and Daniel leave the hotel early to visit places associated with Romeo and Juliet.
At breakfast, the Ohio couple notices Lauren's picture in an Italian newspaper with the caption "Dov'e.
".
Janet thinks it means "bird.
peace" but Bob deduces it's asking where she is.
Julius has also seen the paper and intercepts Lauren and Daniel on their way back to the hotel, angry that Lauren lied to him about going to Venice to visit her sick mother.
He angrily tells them that everyone now thinks that he is a kidnapper, for which "they will put me away" but can't bring himself to reveal that he has a criminal record as a pickpocket.
Because they can no longer go back to the hotel, they join a local bicycle race to escape Verona.
Julius soon falls behind and Lauren persuades Daniel to go back for him.
They find his bike abandoned and him collapsed from exhaustion.
Daniel worms his background out of Julius, who also confesses that he both picked Bob's pocket and stole the money for their train tickets, disappointing Lauren.
Lauren then reveals that she will be moving back to the United States permanently in two weeks.
She wanted to take a gondola to the Bridge of Sighs and kiss Daniel so as they could love each other forever.
She berates Julius by dismissing all his stories as lies.
Julius admits the truth of it but insists that the legend is not a lie.
Daniel says that he is still going to Venice, and Lauren and Julius join him.
In Venice they spend the night in st Mark's Basilica, sleeping in the confessionals, until a chance meeting with the Duryeas sets them on the run again hours before sunset.
Julius hides them in a movie theater and gives them his remaining cash, promising to return a half-hour before sunset.
As soon as they are inside, however, Julius turns himself in to police searching for them.
They fall asleep during the film and awake with just a few minutes remaining.
Julius is nowhere to be seen, taken to a police station, but despite being slapped around by an inspector, refuses to reveal their whereabouts until the bells of the Campanile have rung.
Not knowing where Julius is and with so little time, Lauren and Daniel run to find a gondola, most of which are booked by tourists eager to see the sunset from the canals.
When an unoccupied gondola appears, its gondolier quotes a fare of 15,000 lire, 3,000 more than Julius gave them.
Because his father drives a cab, however, Daniel knows how to cajole the gondolier into accepting what they have.
The gondolier takes them within sight of the bridge but refuses to go further just as sunset arrives.
Daniel pushes him into the canal and as the Campanile begins chiming, pulls the gondola towards the bridge hand over hand using the pilings.
With Lauren's help they set the gondola in motion and cuddle as the boat glides under the bridge.
While the bells are still pealing, Lauren and Daniel kiss and embrace.
In the police station, Julius finally reveals where Lauren is and what she is doing.
A few days later, Lauren is back with both her mother and stepfather, preparing to leave for home.
As she starts to enter the car, Lauren notices Daniel across the street, waiting to say goodbye to her.
Her mother starts to object but her stepfather tells Lauren to go ahead.
She and Daniel share a final kiss, pledging not to become "like everybody else".
Julius is sitting on a nearby bench and she bids him a tearful farewell.
Overcome with emotion, she runs back to her car.
Daniel follows the retreating car down the street, watching Lauren wave through the rear window.
A frustrated Parisian driver cuts in between them; Daniel jumps up so as he can see Lauren.
The camera freezes on Daniel's face and zooms in, Lauren's last memory of Daniel until they can see each other again.

Kissing Jessica Stein

Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier.
The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men.
Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little.
As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good.
Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man.
They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another.
Even when Helen gets sick&mdash;which she says earlier in the film never happens to her&mdash;Jessica is there to care for her.
The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy.
Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions.
Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale.
In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret.
Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them.
One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement.
Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica.
Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup.
It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating.
Her mother reminds Jessica of when she was little and had been given the lead in the school play, but after the first rehearsal, Jessica had deemed her co-star not to be up to the task.
She quit the play because she thought the play wouldn't be "the best ever".
Her mother says that she worries about Jessica having this attitude towards life, and that sometimes she thinks back to that night and thinks that if Jessica went on, maybe it wouldn't have been the best, but it might have been pretty good&mdash;and who knows, maybe it would have been the best ever.
She then tells Jessica that she thinks Helen "is a very nice girl".
This acceptance on her mother's part gives Jessica the confidence to come out in the open with her relationship with Helen, and invites her as her guest to her brother's wedding.
Helen quickly becomes popular with the other women at the reception, who don't seem to mind at all her lesbian relationship with Jessica.
At the same time, Jessica gets a love confession from her ex-beau and current boss Josh, who declares he's had feelings for her for a long time.
Jessica rejects him, explaining that she already has Helen.
Jessica and Helen move in together, but their relationship, while good in most respects, begins to suffer from a lack of frequent sexual intimacy.
Jessica's behavior towards Helen is more akin to that of a best friend rather than a sexual partner.
The relationship ends amidst Jessica's tears and Helen's realization that she wants more than Jessica is willing to offer.
After moving beyond the heartbreak, Jessica and Helen appear to remain friends, and it is suggested that Jessica might now have a renewed interest in Josh, after both have left the newspaper where they previously worked.

Antoine is suspicious, but cannot figure out why.
He taps the new aquarium and the glass shatters.
Deuce then reveals his prostituting adventures to the bemused and furious Antoine.
Enraged, Antoine tries to kill Deuce, and at one point shoots a crossbow bolt at him.
The aforementioned overweight client, Fluisa, shows up, comes between the two men, and saves Deuce's life (she is not killed because the bolt hits her breasts, between which she has hidden a roast chicken).

Clambake

Scott Heyward (Presley) rebels against the plans and expectations of his father, extremely rich oil tycoon Duster Heyward (Gregory).
Scott abandons his family, driving to Florida in his shiny red 1959 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Racer to find himself.
When Scott stops for gas and refreshments, he encounters Tom Wilson (Hutchins), who is on his way to take a job as a waterskiing instructor at a Miami hotel.
Scott and Tom make small talk, and a chance remark by Tom gives Scott an idea: He switches identities with Tom so he can find out how people react to him as an ordinary person rather than a millionaire.
Tom has fun staying at the same hotel and pretending he is rich.
Shortly after, hotel guest Dianne Carter (Fabares) insists on taking a lesson minutes after Scott checks in with his new "employer".
However, once they are out on the water, Dianne proves herself to be an expert skier, performing fancy maneuvers to gain the attention of wealthy young playboy James Jamison III (Bixby).
Later, Dianne confesses to Scott that she is a gold digger, assuming that he is one, too.
Scott agrees to help Dianne land Jamison, but ends up falling for her himself.
Scott persuades boat builder Sam Burton (Merrill) to allow him to rebuild the Rawhide, a damaged high-performance boat, and drive it in the annual Orange Bowl Race, which Jamison has won the last three years.

Between his day job and moonlighting as a chemist, Scott is run ragged, but he manages to (hopefully) fix goop's major flaw: losing its strength in water.
With no time for testing before the race, he applies it to the boat's hull and prays it will hold the Rawhide together.
Duster learns where his son is and comes to see what he is doing.
To Scott's surprise, his father is enormously proud of what he has accomplished.
Meanwhile, Jamison proposes to Dianne.
Scott barges into the suite before she can give Jamison an answer, but the obviously jealous playboy informs Scott they are getting married right after he wins the race.
In the race, Jamison takes the lead in his boat, the Scarlet Lady, but Scott passes him at the finish line.
Dianne decides to give up her scheme and return home.
Scott then offers to give Dianne a lift.
On the drive, he gives her an engagement ring he bought with the winnings from the race.
Dianne insists that Scott take it back, but agrees to marry him.
This prompts Scott to confess to Dianne who he really is.
She does not believe him at first, but when he shows her his driver's license as proof, she faints.

The Millionairess

By the terms of her late father's will, spoiled London heiress Epifania Ognissanti di Parerga, the richest woman in the world, cannot marry unless her prospective husband is able to turn £500 into £15,000 within a three-month period.
When Epifania becomes smitten with Alastair, a muscular tennis player, she rigs the contest by giving him £500 in stock and then buying it back for £15,000.
Alastair is unable to live with the domineering Epifania, however, and leaves her for the more domestic Polly Smith.
Contemplating suicide, Epifania melodramatically plunges into the Thames, and when dr Ahmed el Kabir, a self-effacing, selfless Indian physician who runs an inadequately equipped clinic for the poor, ignores her plight and paddles past in his rowboat, she swims to shore and accuses him of being an assassin.
Julius Sagamore, the shrewd family solicitor, then suggests that Epifania undergo therapy with noted society psychiatrist Adrian Bond.
The opportunist Bond makes a bid for her hand, but after he criticises her father, Epifania throws him into the Thames, and when Kabir rows out to help Bond, Epifania jumps in the river after him.
To ensnare Kabir, Epifania feigns injury, but the dedicated doctor remains impervious to her charms and indifferent to her wealth.
Determined to win the doctor, Epifania buys the property surrounding his clinic and then erects a new, modern facility.
After Kabir rejects Epifania's offer to run the facility, she suggests that they marry instead.
Intimidated by the headstrong heiress, Kabir manufactures a deathbed promise that he made to his mother, pledging that he would not marry unless his prospective bride can take 35 shillings and earn her own living for three months.
Undaunted, Epifania accepts his challenge and then discloses the details of her father's will and hands him £500.
When Kabir protests that he has no head for money, Epifania plops down the wad of bills and leaves.
Setting out to prove her worth, Epifania takes 35 shillings and heads for a sweatshop pasta factory.
There, she threatens to expose the labour violations unless Joe, the proprietor, allows her to manage the plant.
Three months later, Epifania has installed labour-saving machines, thus boosting productivity and making the plant a big success.
Kabir, meanwhile, has tried in vain to give away his £500.
After Kabir becomes drunk at a scientific dinner hosted by a wealthy doctor, he finds a sympathetic ear in his former professor and mentor, who generously offers to accept his money.
At the clinic, Kabir eagerly turns over the cash to the professor.
Soon after the professor leaves, Epifania appears and informs Kabir that she has met his mother's challenge.
When he replies that he has failed and given all the money away, Epifania is deeply offended.
Deciding to turn her back on the world of men, she announces that she plans to fire her board of directors, disband her empire and retire to a Tibetan monastery once she has evicted all the monks.
Desperate to keep his job, Sagamore realises that Kabir is responsible for Epifania's erratic behaviour and goes to see the doctor.
At the clinic, Sagamore tells Kabir that Epifania has vowed to withdraw from the world at the stroke of midnight.
Concerned, Kabir hurries to the reception where Epifania is to bid farewell to her previous existence.
Certain that their marriage is now imminent, Sagamore meets the terms of the will by purchasing Kabir's medical papers for £15,000.
After Kabir rushes to Epifania, they kiss and he finally expresses his love.

The Frog Prince

In the tale, a spoiled princess reluctantly befriends the Frog Prince (meeting him after dropping a gold ball into a pond), who magically transforms into a handsome prince.
Although in modern versions the transformation is invariably triggered by the princess kissing the frog, in the original Grimm version of the story the frog's spell was broken when the princess threw it against a wall in disgust.
In other early versions it was sufficient for the frog to spend the night on the princess' pillow.
The frog prince also has a loyal servant named Henry (or Harry) who had three iron bands affixed around his heart to prevent it from breaking in his sadness over his master's curse, but when the prince was reverted to his human form Henry's overwhelming happiness caused all three bands to break, freeing his heart from its bonds.

Welcome to Mooseport

Former President of the United States Monroe "Eagle" Cole retires to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, Maine to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte.
Harold "Handy" Harrison is a commoner working as the local plumber of Mooseport, who also owns a hardware store.
Following the death of the town mayor, the town council decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office.
Cole agrees because, as it turns out, if he holds the office, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his divorce settlement.
As a surprise to Harrison, his name has also been entered into the race.
When Harrison finds out Cole is running, he decides to withdraw, until he witnesses Cole make a pass at Handy's girlfriend of six years, veterinarian dr Sally Mannis, who recently broke up with him because he was taking the relationship too slow and had not yet proposed marriage to her.
Handy believes that, by becoming mayor, he can show Sally he is a mature decision maker and win her heart.
Tempers rise following the arrival of ex-wife and Cole campaign spoiler Charlotte.
Cole's team, led by long-time executive secretary and love interest Grace Sutherland and presidential aide Will Bullard, bring in strong support in the form of campaign strategist Bert Langdon, who becomes Cole's campaign manager as he complains of a dull existence since Cole retired from the presidency.
As the campaigns progress, Cole and Harrison both become obsessed with winning the race at all costs, although Harrison refuses to resort to any cheating schemes, making Cole realize that in all his years of running for elections this may be the hardest as he is taking on an honest everyman.
Eventually, on the night before the election, both candidates (for different reasons - Cole trying to get sympathy votes, Harrison wanting the campaign to end and believes Cole would be a better mayor than him) urge the voters to vote for the other candidate by saying that neither of them will vote for themselves.
Harrison keeps his promise, but Cole votes for himself anyway.
Upon the revelation that Cole won by one vote, his conscience gets the better of him and he concedes the match to Harrison.
However, Harrison lies that he voted for himself as well, and declines office, making Cole end up as mayor once again.
Harrison later reveals to Sally that he conceded the election because Cole needs the mayorship more than he does and that all he really wanted was to propose marriage to her, which he does.
As Handy is proposing to Sally, Monroe also proposes to Grace.
The film ends with Bert Langdon telling Handy that he ran an excellent campaign and offers to be his campaign manager for Governor of Maine, which Handy shows some interest in when he realizes a governor has certain authority over mayors.

People Will Talk

People Will Talk describes an episode in the life of dr Noah Praetorius (Cary Grant), a physician who teaches in a medical school and founded a clinic dedicated to treating patients humanely and holistically.
The plot contains two parallel story lines: a professional-misconduct challenge brought against Praetorius by his more conventional colleague dr Rodney Elwell (Hume Cronyn), who dislikes Praetorius's unorthodox but effective methods; and the struggle of a distressed young woman named Deborah Higgins (Jeanne Crain), who falls in love with Praetorius while dealing with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
The film also highlights Praetorius's close friend and confidant, physics professor Lyonel Barker (Walter Slezak), who plays bass viol in the student/faculty orchestra conducted by Praetorius.
At the start of the film, Elwell has hired a detective to investigate Praetorius.
A housemaid (Margaret Hamilton) who once worked for Praetorius reacts visibly when Elwell asks her about Praetorius's mysterious friend mr Shunderson, who rarely leaves Praetorius's side and has a deep, intuitive understanding of human and animal nature.
Elwell's detective discovers that Shunderson was once convicted of murder, and Elwell calls for a misconduct hearing against Praetorius.
At the hearing, Praetorius explains that he started his career in a small town by opening a butcher shop as a front for his undeclared medical practice, because the people of the town didn't trust doctors.
Elwell accuses Praetorius of "quackery", but Praetorius defends himself with the fact that he was a licensed practitioner, describing how he was forced to leave town after his maid discovered his medical degree.
Praetorius refuses to answer questions about Shunderson, but Shunderson explains that he served 15 years in prison for the alleged death of a man who had tried to murder him, then somehow survived being hanged after actually murdering the man, who had gone into hiding during the first trial.
When he woke up, he was lying on a table in front of Praetorius, who was at that time a medical student examining what he believed was a cadaver.
Praetorius kept Shunderson's survival a secret, and Shunderson became Praetorius's devoted friend.
After this story is told, the chairman concludes the hearing in Praetorius's favor, and Elwell walks away alone and discredited.
Meanwhile, Deborah enters Praetorius's life, displaying signs of emotional distress.
After she faints during a lecture, Praetorius examines her and informs her that she's pregnant.
Upset by this news, "Mrs.
Higgins" admits that she's not really married.
The unborn child's father is dead, and knowing about her condition would be too much for her own father to bear.

Praetorius and Shunderson drive out to where Deborah and her father Arthur live, a farm owned by Arthur's brother, John.
Deborah and Praetorius hide Deborah's shooting incident from her father, who is a failure in life and lives unhappily as a dependent of his stingy brother.
Deborah is his only pride in life, which might become intolerable for him with a baby to take care of and his daughter's reputation ruined.
While showing Praetorius the farm, Deborah admits her love for him.
She also wonders why he is visiting and begins to suspect that he is attracted to her.
After she seductively interrogates him, they share a passionate kiss.
They soon get married, and Arthur comes to live with them.
A few weeks later, Deborah suggests to Noah that she may be pregnant, and he admits that she was pregnant all along.
She ruefully concludes that he married her out of pity, but he convinces her that he really did fall in love with her.

Monster-in-Law

Charlie Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) is a temp/dog walker/yoga instructor and aspiring fashion designer from Venice Beach, California, who meets doctor Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan).
She thinks he's gay at first, based on a lie Kevin's former girlfriend Fiona (Monet Mazur) told her.
But then Kevin asks her out, and Charlie believes that she's finally found the right man.
Things start to go wrong when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda).
Viola is a former newscaster, who has recently been replaced by someone younger, and is in the midst of a meltdown.
Loathing Charlie from the outset, Viola becomes even more distraught when Kevin proposes to Charlie.
Fearing that she'll lose her son the same way she lost her career, she sets out to ruin Kevin and Charlie's relationship.
With Ruby (Wanda Sykes), her assistant, she tries everything possible to drive Charlie away.
Charlie eventually catches on to Viola's plan and fights back.
On Charlie's wedding day, Viola turns up wearing a white dress instead of the peach-colored dress specially made for her.
This leads to a violent stand-off between the two, leading with Viola refusing to accept Charlie and states she'll never be good enough for Kevin.
Suddenly, Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevin's grandmother, Gertrude Fields (Elaine Stritch), appears and they have an indignant argument, while Gertrude takes a liking to Charlie, saying she is stunning, her grandson is a lucky man, that she is an "exotic Latina", and if only her son, Kevin's father, was as lucky to find a woman like Charlie.
Gertrude's resentment of Viola bears a strong resemblance to Viola's feelings of animosity toward Charlie.
Gertrude even believes that Kevin's father had died years ago of "terminal disappointment", for which Gerturde holds Viola responsible.
Viola counters stating Gertrude "smothered him to death", because she thought nobody was ever good enough for him (basically similar to how Viola is).
Gertrude, satisfied she got her last word in, leaves; showing she still favors Charlie.
Charlie decides to back down as she witnesses Gertrude and Viola's relationship.
"Nothing's going to change", she laments to Viola after Gertrude leaves the room, "In thirty years that will be us".
Charlie exits to tell Kevin that the wedding is off.
But before that can happen, Ruby enters and talks with Viola.
Viola is miffed that Charlie compared her to Gertrude, although Ruby points out that Viola is actually far worse than Gertrude, as she doesn't ever recall Gertrude trying to poison Viola once, referring to earlier at the rehearsal dinner when Viola put crushed nuts (which Charlie is highly allergic to) in the meal's gravy.
Ruby points out that Viola's efforts against Charlie to make Kevin happy are unwarranted.
"Whatever made you think he wasn't.
" is her final point.
Viola has an epiphany and realizes that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile, which ends the feud.
Charlie then explains to Viola that she wants her to stay, too, on one condition: if Viola accepts the boundaries Charlie needs, if she is present at any family event, and if she treats her children with love.
Charlie and Kevin then get married and when Charlie throws her wedding bouquet, Viola catches the flowers.
As Charlie and Kevin drive away to their honeymoon, the film ends as Viola and Ruby walk out of the celebration.

Don barely tolerates his vain, cunning, and shallow leading lady, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity.
Lina is convinced they are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise.
At the premiere of his newest film, The Royal Rascal, Don tells the gathered crowd an exaggerated version of his life story, including his motto: "Dignity, always dignity".
His words are humorously contradicted by flashbacks showing him alongside his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor).
To escape from his fans after the premiere, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).
She drops him off, but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his "undignified" accomplishments as a movie star.

Simpson (Millard Mitchell), shows a short demonstration of a talking picture, but his guests are unimpressed.

The Duelling Cavaliers test screening is a disaster; the actors are barely audible thanks to the awkward placing of the microphones, Don repeats the line "I love you" to Lina over and over, to the audience's derisive laughter, and in the middle of the film, the sound goes out of synchronization, with hilarious results.
Don, Kathy and Cosmo come up with the idea to turn The Duelling Cavalier into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier, complete with a modern musical number called "Broadway Melody".

approves the idea but tells them not to inform Lina about the dubbing.

She becomes even angrier when she discovers thatF.
intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup afterward.

He falls in love with a driver from the motor pool, Emily Barham (Julie Andrews), who has lost her husband, brother, and father in the war.
Madison's pleasure-seeking "American" lifestyle amid wartime rationing both fascinates and disgusts Emily, but she does not want to lose another loved one to war and finds the "practicing coward" Madison irresistible.
Profoundly despondent since the death of his wife, Jessup obsesses over the US Army and its Air Force overshadowing the Navy in the forthcoming D-Day invasion.
The mentally unstable admiral decides that "The first dead man on Omaha Beach must be a sailor".
A combat film will document the death, and the casualty will be buried in a "Tomb of the Unknown Sailor".
He orders Madison to get the film made.
Despite his best efforts to avoid the duty, Madison and his now gung-ho friend, Commander "Bus" Cummings (James Coburn), find themselves and a film crew with the combat engineers, who will be the first sailors ashore.

A relieved Jessup plans to show him off during his Senate testimony as the "first man on Omaha Beach", a sailor.
Madison, limping from his injury and angry about his senseless near-death, uncharacteristically plans to act nobly by telling the world the truth about what happened, even if it means being imprisoned for cowardice.

Nutty Professor II: The Klumps

After finding success with a DNA restructuring formula in the first film, Sherman Klump has created another formula which enables those who take it to find the Fountain of Youth.
He has also met and fallen in love with a colleague, Denise Gaines, who has developed a method to isolate genetic material and later becomes his fiancée.
Together, their work has enabled Wellman College to receive a $150 million award from a pharmaceutical firm to the excitement of Dean Richmond.
Despite his good fortune, Sherman has a major problem: the personality of his vanquished alter ego, Buddy Love, is still ingrained inside him and causes him to act out in the same crass manner Buddy does.
After a few particularly unpleasant incidents, from Buddy kicking in, when Sherman sexually insults his own therapist trying to help him with it, then does the same thing to a woman walking a dog, and later during a toast turns around and reveals that his father was fired rather than retired, and then when Sherman intended on proposing to Denise, but then Buddy kicks in and makes it a perverted sex request, causing Denise to become mortified against him.
Sherman heads to his lab where he uses Denise's methodology to isolate and remove the gene in Sherman's DNA where Buddy has manifested.
Determined to be rid of Buddy permanently, and despite of Jason warning him of potentially catastrophic consequences for his health, Sherman extracts the gene with from inside his body.
However, he does not dispose of the genetic material and as a result, Buddy becomes a sentient being when a hair from a Basset Hound who was Sherman's test subject finds its way into it and causes such a reaction.
To make matters worse, Jason's suspicions prove correct when Sherman discovers that, due to the extraction, his brain cells are beginning to deteriorate.
Realizing he needs to keep the youth formula out of Buddy's hands, Sherman stashes it at his parents' house.
Buddy, who is trying to sell the formula to a different company, quickly realizes where it is and steals some of it.
Buddy also doctors the remainder with fertilizer, which causes chaos at a demonstration the next day when a hamster Sherman uses to demonstrate the youth finding effects instead mutates and becomes an aggressive monster who violates Dean Richmond in front of a live television audience.
The humiliated Dean fires Sherman, who learns that his brain's deterioration has worsened from Jason.
Sherman then decides to end his engagement and break up with Denise.
In a last-ditch effort to secure the money, Sherman quickly works on a newer, much more potent formula while his mental faculties allow him to.
While he is doing this, Richmond confronts him about Buddy's actions believing the two are working together.
He leaves with Richmond and a tennis ball and head to the competing firm.
Meanwhile, a worried Denise discovers what has happened and that Sherman's brain damage has progressed to almost eighty percent.
Enlisting the help of Sherman's father Cletus, Denise heads for the firm Buddy is selling the formula to.
There, Sherman sets his plan into motion.
Taking advantage of the canine DNA that crossed with Buddy's, Sherman uses the tennis ball to play fetch.
The ball is covered with the new formula, which takes Buddy back to an infantile state and eventually to a glowing mass of genetic material.
The idea is for Sherman to suck the genetic material back into his body through a straw, thus putting his DNA back together and returning him to normal.
However, as Sherman is chasing what is left of Buddy, the glowing mass evaporates and thus Sherman cannot restore his intelligence.
Denise and Cletus arrive too late to save him, and seeing what has happened to Sherman, Denise breaks into tears.
As they go to leave, Sherman takes a look at a fountain in the lobby of the building and remarks that it is "pretty".
Seeing that the water is glowing, Denise realizes that the genetic material has reconstituted and that if Sherman drinks the water before it dissipates, he will be restored to normal.
Although reluctant at first, Sherman drinks two handfuls of the water from Denise's hand then Cletus dunks Sherman's head under the water to drink, and thus he is able to get his genetic makeup back in proper order.
The film closes with Denise and Sherman's wedding reception, with Buddy nowhere to be found.

The Pleasure Seekers

Three beautiful American women come to Madrid and fall in love.
Susie Higgins (Pamela Tiffin) arrives and moves in with her old friend Maggie Williams (Carol Lynley) and roommate Fran Hobson (Ann-Margret).
Susie experiences a culture shock, when she is informed by Maggie and Fran that all rich, attractive men are taken, and all attractive but poor ones are too proud to take on American women.
It becomes clear to Susie that she is nothing like her roommates.
Maggie, for instance, is a secretary who has recently ended an affair and is now in love with her married boss Paul Barton (Brian Keith), much to the dismay of her co-worker Pete McCoy (Gardner McKay), a newspaper man.
Fran, an aspiring actress, flamenco dancer and singer, stumbles upon an attractive Spanish doctor dr Andres Briones (André Lawrence) and immediately falls for him, even though he does not seem to be interested.
While at the Museo del Prado, Susie catches the eye of wealthy playboy Emilio Lacayo (Anthony Franciosa).
Homesick, she is comforted by the kind words of Emilio and dismisses Maggie's warnings that he is a "corrupt, heartless man".
During a party, where Fran delivers a musical performance, Susie is surprised by Emilio's interest in another girl and his lack of attention for her.
Maggie is upset that a dance between her and Paul is interrupted by his jealous wife Jane (Gene Tierney).
She asks Pete for a ride home and learns his plans to leave Madrid for Paris, which is caused by his dislike of Paul.
Feeling that he is behaving too much like a playboy, Maggie admits that she thinks that Pete could be a great newspaper man if he tried.
The next morning, Susie attempts to take revenge on Emilio with a devious plan.
Fran offers to aid her, but when she crosses paths with dr Briones, she dismisses her friend to spend a romantic afternoon with him.
Briones criticizes Fran's mockery of her own career, though she rationalizes this by claiming that one should not be serious about a career that is going nowhere.
Hereafter, she claims that Briones has left her and that she is planning on returning to the United States.
Susie sets out to make Emilio believe that she is falling for him.
When he proposes marriage, she hastily accepts and rushes into the proceedings -- with the intention to scare him off -- much to his surprise.

She throws a tantrum, blaming him for thinking that she is "easy".
Susie comforts her by informing her about her engagement to Emilio.
Then they find out that Fran has left the house.
They worry about her, without realizing that she is spending her final days at the beach in Malagá happily with Briones.
Fran offers to cancel her plane to stay with Briones in Malagá, helping him to save money for his clinic, though he has too much pride to ask her not to leave.
Fran returns home to Madrid, telling her friends that Briones was too poor to support her.
Susie is stood up by Emilio on an afternoon when she is scheduled to meet his mother (Isobel Elsom).
She decides to visit by herself, and is shocked that mrs Lacayo has no idea who she is.
The older woman apologizes for her son's behavior and explains that this is not the first time that Emilio misled a girl, leaving Susie heartbroken.
Back at home, Maggie runs to a formal party with Paul, where she is confronted by Jane for being Paul's mistress.
Maggie defends herself by claiming that Jane has lost her husband due to her lack of love for him, and when she furthermore expresses her pity, Jane slaps her and leaves.
Maggie gets drunk and allows Pete to take her home.
They are about to kiss when she passes out.
The following day, Maggie visits the office to inform Paul that she will return to New York with Fran and Susie.
Paul accepts the situation and even arranges a meeting with Emilio to make him realize that he has made a mistake with Susie.
On their final evening, the three women attend yet another party, where Paul announces his shift to New York.
The women decide to stay and are all reunited with their men, though Maggie ends not with Paul, but with Pete, who will be Paul's successor in Madrid.

Hatari!

Hatari.
is the story of a group of adventurers in East Africa, engaged in the exciting and lucrative but dangerous business of catching wild animals for delivery to zoos around the world.
As "Momella Game Ltd".
, they operate from a compound near the town of Arusha.
The head of the group is Sean Mercer (John Wayne); the others are safari veteran Little Wolf a/k/a "the Indian" (Bruce Cabot); drivers "Pockets" (Red Buttons), a former Brooklyn taxi driver, and Kurt (Hardy Krüger), a German auto racing driver; roper Luis (Valentin de Vargas), a former Mexican bullfighter, and Brandy (Michele Girardon), a young woman whose late father was a member of the group; she grew up there and owns the business.
Their method (shown in several action sequences) is to chase the selected animal across the plains with a truck, driven by Pockets.
Sean stands in the bed of the truck with a rope noose on a long pole, and snags the animal by its head.
(For smaller animals, Sean rides in a seat mounted on the truck's left front fender) A smaller, faster "herding car," driven by Kurt, swings outside, driving the animal back toward the "catching truck".
Once the animal is snagged, Luis, an expert roper, catches its legs and secures it.
The animal is then moved into a travel crate and carried on a third truck, driven by Brandy.
The captured animals are held in pens in the compound, tended by native workers, until they are shipped out at the end of the hunting season.
In the opening sequence, the team chases a rhinoceros, but it attacks the herding car and severely gores the Indian, who has to be transported to the Arusha hospital.
While they are waiting to hear about the Indian's condition, a young Frenchman (Gerard Blain) approaches Sean about taking the Indian's job.
This offends Kurt, who knocks the Frenchman down.
Then dr Sanderson (Eduard Franz) says the Indian may die without a transfusion of rare type AB Negative blood.
However, the Frenchman has that blood type.
He agrees to donate his blood for the transfusion.
The group returns to the compound after celebrating the Indian's survival.
Sean is surprised to find a strange woman sleeping in his bed.
The next morning, she introduces herself as Anna Maria D'Alessandro ("Just call me Dallas") (Elsa Martinelli), a photojournalist sent by the Basel Zoo to record the capture of the animals they have ordered.
Sean is annoyed, but under the contract with the zoo they must accommodate her.
Dallas quickly makes friends with the others, especially Pockets.
She rides along on the group's catching runs, snapping pictures.
Dallas is immediately attracted to Sean, and (she thinks) he to her, but he treats her brusquely.
Pockets explains that a few years earlier, Sean was engaged to a woman who came to the compound, hated Sean's life there, and abruptly left him.
Ever since, he distrusts women, especially those to whom he is attracted.
The young Frenchman comes to the compound and, after proving himself a crack shot, is hired to replace the Indian for the rest of the catching season.
His name is Charles Maurey, but Sean dubs him "Chips".
His job is to ride with Kurt in the herding car, carrying a rifle in case an animal attacks.
The Indian returns, and urges Sean to forego catching any rhinos this season.
A "nice Belgian kid" was killed in an earlier rhino chase, as was Brandy's father; now the Indian was nearly killed.
He suggests there is a jinx.
Sean agrees only to postpone rhino to the end of the season.
Dallas makes some progress with Sean, but friction between them continues, especially after Dallas adopts first one, then two, and finally three orphaned elephant calves.
This leads to her adoption into the local Warusha tribe as "Mama Tembo" ("Mother of Elephants").
Chips and Kurt flirt with Brandy, but as things turn out, it is Pockets Brandy falls for.
This becomes clear to everyone on a day when the herding car flips over, dislocating Kurt's shoulder and cutting Chips up.
Brandy doesn't react much to their injuries, but when Pockets falls off a fence and wrenches his back, she is nearly hysterical with worry over his "injury".
Animal chases continue, with the group capturing a zebra, a giraffe, a gazelle, a buffalo, and a wildebeest.
They also trap a leopard in a baited cage.
When the herding car is mired during a river crossing, Chips shoots a crocodile that is threatening Kurt, and a strong friendship develops between them.
Pockets spends several days privately tinkering in the compound workshop.
He invents a method of flinging a net over a tree full of monkeys, which the zoos want.
His rocket-net is a success, catching over 500 of them.
With all other orders filled, the group catches a rhino without serious incident, and the Indian agrees that the jinx is broken.
The group goes to Arusha to celebrate the end of the season, but Dallas declines.
She is frustrated, because though she has had some intimate moments with Sean, he has never clearly declared how he feels about her.
When Sean urges her to join the group's excursion, she lashes out at him and bursts into tears, leaving him baffled.
The next morning, Dallas has vanished, leaving a farewell letter with Pockets.
Sean and the group rush to Arusha to catch her.
To help locate Dallas they take along one of the baby elephants, to track her by scent.
Not wanting to be left behind, the other two follow the truck to Arusha.
The ensuing chase ends when the elephants corner Dallas in a hotel lobby.
In the final scene, Dallas is again in Sean's bed when he enters the room, and they reprise the dialogue from their first meeting.
As before, Pockets also comes in drunk and again asks Sean "What is she doing in your bed.
" But this time, Sean announces "We got married today.
" After Sean herds Pockets out of their room, Tembo and his two brothers push their way in and break Sean's bed as the newlyweds try to figure out how to deal with them.

The three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together.
Unfortunately, Anna's father got a new job that resulted in the Reillys moving to California, and ultimately she lost touch with Brian and Jake.
Sixteen years later, Anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a New York position.
Feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as Anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as Brian and Jake remembered her; however, it is, ironically, the men's careers that prove to be the most problematic.
She and Jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not Jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - Jake's older brother Ethan - for marrying outside the faith).
Between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications.
As the months pass, both Jake and Anna's feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, Jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite Anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of Jake's congregation while on a date and Jake introducing her only as "my old friend Anna".
Meanwhile, Brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for Anna despite his vows.
Apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with Fr.
Havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself.
Brian begins misinterpreting Anna's words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to Jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her.
Anna tells Jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well.
While the three have dinner one night with Jake's mother Ruth, Ruth has a private conversation with Anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about Anna and Jake's secret relationship.
Jake and Brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later Jake and Anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration.
Anna calls Brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment.
Still unaware of what's been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love.
When she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with Jake and finally admits that she and Jake have been seeing each other secretly for months.
Feeling embarrassed and rejected, Brian raids Anna's liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize.
He leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets.
The next day, still drunk, Brian stumbles into Jake's temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with Jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi.
He leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.
As the Community Center's grand opening approaches, along with the last days of Anna's East Coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with Jake reconciling with Brian, followed by Anna reconciling with Brian shortly after.
A discussion between the two men prompts Jake to go to Anna's office building, with Brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street.
Jake interrupts Anna's going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right.
Later that evening, they surprise Brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start.
Anna greets Rabbi Lewis (Eli Wallach) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that Anna had told Jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to convert to Judaism.
She tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in New York, with Jake clearly thrilled.
The film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.

Summer Lovers

Michael Pappas (Peter Gallagher) and Cathy Featherstone (Daryl Hannah), a young couple from Chicago who have just graduated from college in the United States, have known each other about 10 years and have been together about half that time.
They vacation for the summer on the Greek island of Santorini.
When they visit a nude beach crowded with other young tourists, they are hesitant at first but find themselves getting caught up in the uninhibited energy and decadence that surrounds them.
Cathy reads a book of sexual techniques, then ties Michael to the bed and drips candle wax on his chest.
She comments that everyone thinks she's "such a Goody Two-Shoes" but she wants a little more adventure.
Michael, who says he has never been with another woman, keeps noticing Lina Broussard (Valerie Quennessen), a French archaeologist on temporary assignment at the nearby Akrotiri excavation.
One day, at the beach without Cathy, he gets his chance to talk to Lina and ends up starting an affair with her.
He then feels so guilty that Cathy immediately notices something is wrong, and he admits what he has done, insisting that he still loves Cathy.
Cathy is naturally disturbed by this, but tells him to get it out of his system, which he takes as permission to return to Lina.
Cathy then goes to a local bar intending to sleep with another man as a way to get revenge against Michael for cheating on her.
But in the end she chickens out after getting picked up by an amorous local boy.
When Michael comes home later after seeing Lina again, Cathy says she wants out of the relationship.
Cathy goes to Lina's home to confront her.
Lina assures Cathy that she does not intend to take Michael away from her, which seems to calm Cathy somewhat.
Lina and Cathy end up spending several hours together getting acquainted, and find themselves fascinated by each other's work — Lina's archeology and Cathy's photography.
Michael is confused when he learns that the two women are developing a friendship, but he quickly recovers and the three of them spend a few days gradually getting closer.
Cathy knows Michael is still sleeping with Lina from time to time, but seems to accept it, although she says it would be difficult for her to see them in bed together.
Nevertheless, she tolerates increasing signs of affection between Michael and Lina in her presence.
In a very tense scene one evening, Cathy encourages Michael to kiss Lina.
He gives Lina a light peck, but Cathy says it isn't convincing.
He gradually turns up the heat while watching Cathy intently for her reaction.
He then kisses Cathy, checking to see how this makes Lina feel.
The three end up spending the night together.
Lina moves in with them, and they continue enjoying the island paradise as a threesome.
Just as the fantasy seems to be a total success, the natural complications of domestic life, like who does the laundry or dishes, come to the foreground.
The three work through these problems, but then Cathy's mother (Barbara Rush) appears on a surprise visit, snapping everyone back to reality.
Cathy tells her mother she's never been happier in her life.
Although Lina claims to be bad at relationships and prefers just "screwing", the three actually seem to be falling in love all around.
Aside from Lina's comment that she prefers just "screwing," the sexually charged plot is underscored by a number of other instances of openly sexual comments and humor.
For example, when Cathy's mother comes to visit and is checking into a hotel on the island, the desk clerk asks a woman checking out "how many douches did you have ma'am.
".
The woman looks at the clerk awkwardly until her friend explains "he means showers".
Finding herself in an intense relationship, and uncertain about her future with them, Lina begins to fear getting hurt when the summer ends and the Americans return home.
They tell her it doesn't have to end, but don't go into any details.
To avoid getting too close to her new friends, Lina disappears with another young man, Jan Tolin (Hans van Tongeren), she met at the beach.
Cathy and Michael are distraught, and spend several days searching for Lina.
Eventually they conclude they won't find her as long as she wants to remain hidden.
But their memories of Lina loom over everything they try to do, and they can no longer enjoy their time on the island.
They pack up to return home, even though they have three weeks remaining prepaid on their rental.
Lina finds her fears are outweighed by her feelings for the Americans, and returns to reunite with them, only to discover they have already gone.
She races to the airport and intercepts them just as they are about to board the aircraft.
Overjoyed at seeing her again, Cathy and Michael return to spend the last three weeks of their summer with her.

Other People's Money

Lawrence "Larry the Liquidator" Garfield (Danny DeVito) is a successful corporate raider who has become rich buying up companies and selling off their assets.
With the help of a computerized stock analyzing program called Carmen, Garfield has identified New England Wire & Cable as his next target.
The struggling company is run by the benevolent and folksy Andrew "Jorgy" Jorgenson (Gregory Peck) and is the primary employer in its small Rhode Island town.
After stubbornly insisting that no outsider can seize control of a business his father began, Jorgy is finally persuaded to hire his stepdaughter Kate (Penelope Ann Miller), a big-city lawyer, to defend against a hostile takeover.
Garfield is instantly smitten with the beautiful Kate, although he is on to her tactics and does not waver from his goal of becoming the majority stockholder of New England Wire & Cable.
Garfield tactlessly and unsuccessfully tries to seduce her.
Despite their antagonism, Kate finds herself attracted to Garfield's bold nature.
The takeover attempt begins to fracture the New England Wire & Cable family.
Kate's mother Bea (Piper Laurie) secretly travels to Garfield's offices to offer one million dollars in greenmail to Garfield if he'll go away, but he refuses, stating, "I don't take money from widows or orphans".
Trusted company president Bill Coles (Dean Jones), fearful that the takeover will leave him with nothing, offers to let Garfield vote his shares in the company in exchange for a million-dollar payout.
Garfield agrees, but specifies that Coles will get only half as much if his shares fail to make up the margin of victory.
Garfield concedes to Jorgy's offer to let the matter be settled at the annual shareholder's meeting.
Relying on the support of longtime friends and investors, Jorgy makes an impassioned plea to save the company, appealing to the traditions of manufacturing as opposed to the new breed of capitalism which Larry the Liquidator represents, in which buyers of companies create no products or jobs and are interested only in money.
The shareholders seem swayed by Jorgy's speech and boo Garfield when he gets up to give a rebuttal.
In his rebuttal, Garfield compares New England Wire & Cable to the last buggy whip manufacturer, arguing that even though the company's product may be high quality, changing technology has rendered it obsolete.
Rather than running a failing business into the ground, he contends that the shareholders should follow his lead and get what value they can from the stock before the company's inevitable demise.
At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.
When the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company.
The margin of victory is greater than Coles' shares and thus he does not receive the full amount he betrayed Jorgy to get.
Back at home in Manhattan, Garfield finds himself uncharacteristically despondent after his victory, having realized he has lost his chance for a romance with Kate.
Just then, Kate calls.
She's been having discussions with a Japanese automaker that wants to hire New England Wire & Cable to manufacture stainless steel wire cloth for making airbags, something which will make the company profitable again.
An excited Garfield invites her to dinner to discuss it.

The Prince and the Showgirl

The film is set in London in June 1911.
George V will be crowned king on 22 June and in the preceding days many important dignitaries arrive.
Among those arriving are the 16-year-old King Nicholas VIII of Carpathia, with his Prince Regent father, Charles (Laurence Olivier), a secondary Prince of Hungary and widower of the Queen of Carpathia.
The British government realises that keeping Balkan country Carpathia in the Triple Entente is critical during the rising tensions in Europe.
They find it necessary to pamper the royals during their stay in London, and thus civil servant Northbrook (Richard Wattis), is detached to their service.
Northbrook decides to take the Prince Regent out to the musical performance The Coconut Girl.
During the intermission the Prince Regent is taken backstage to meet the cast.
He is particularly uninterested in engaging with the male actors and extremely interested in the physical charms of Elsie Marina (Marilyn Monroe), one of the performers, and sends a formal written invitation for her to meet him at the Carpathian embassy for supper.
Elsie arrives at the embassy and is soon joined by the Prince Regent, a stiff and pompous man.
She expects a large party but quickly realises the Prince's true intentions – to seduce her over a private supper.
She is persuaded not to leave early by Northbrook, who promises to provide an excuse for her to escape after supper.
The Prince Regent turns his back on her during the supper, taking phone calls and addressing matters of state.
He then makes a clumsy pass at her, to which she is accustomed and immediately rebuffs.
She pointedly explains how inept he is and that she had hoped the Prince was going to sway her with romance, passion and "gypsy violins".
The Prince changes his style and tactics, complete with a violinist.
The two eventually kiss and Elsie admits she may be falling in love, rebuffing Northbrook's promised feint to help her leave the embassy.
Elsie then passes out from the many drinks she consumed before, during and after her semi-solitary supper.
The Prince places her in an adjoining bedroom to stay the night.
The following day, Elsie overhears a conversation concerning the young Nicolas' plotting with the German embassy to overthrow his father.
Promising not to tell, Elsie then meets the Dowager Queen (Sybil Thorndike), the Prince's mother-in-law, who decides Elsie should join them for the coronation in place of her sick lady-in-waiting.
The ceremony passes and Elsie refuses to tell the Prince Regent details of the treasonous plot.
Nicholas then invites her to the Coronation Ball, where she persuades Nicholas to draw up a contract in which he confesses his and the Germans' intent, but only if the Prince agrees to a general election.
The Prince is impressed and realises that he has fallen in love with Elsie.
The morning after the Coronation Ball, Elsie irons out the differences between father and son.
Her honesty and sincerity have inspired the Prince to finally show sincere love to his son.
The next day, the Carpathians must leave to return home.
The Prince Regent had planned to have Elsie join them.
In eighteen months' time, his regency will be over and he will be a free citizen.
She reminds him that that is also the length of her music-hall contract.
They both realise that much can happen in eighteen months and say goodbye.
The ending is ambiguous, left up to the viewer to decide if they will meet again.

The Theory of Flight

Richard (Branagh), an unsuccessful artist who builds primitive flying machines, attempts to fly from the roof of a London office building wearing homemade wings but fails, instead crash-landing and only being saved by a rescue squad.
As a result of his actions Richard is sentenced to community service, in the form of caring for Jane (Bonham-Carter), an ill-tempered, wheelchair-bound woman who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and has run off her previous caretakers.
Over time, Richard and Jane become friends, and eventually Jane asks Richard to help her find someone to lose her virginity to, explaining that she doesn't wish to die a virgin.
Reluctantly Richard helps her search for an appropriate partner, while spending his free time building yet another experimental flying machine.
Eventually the two settle on a high-priced male gigolo (Ray Stevenson) for Jane, who agrees to sleep with her for two thousand pounds.
As neither of them have that amount of money, they conclude that Richard must rob a bank to secure the needed cash.
Richard books a hotel suite for Jane and pays the gigolo five hundred pounds, promising the rest later.
As Richard leaves for the bank job, the gigolo lays a very nervous Jane on the bed, but she begins panicking and decides she no longer wants to go through with it.
Meanwhile, Richard likewise changes his mind, drawing his gun in the bank but then fleeing immediately, calling Jane's name.
He returns to the room and drives off the unhappy gigolo.
Richard and Jane are seen successfully taking a flight in Richard's flying machine, although it breaks apart on landing.
The pair are then seen in bed, implying that Richard has taken Jane's virginity.
Jane dies soon after, and the film ends with Richard placing a commemorative sign honoring Jane's memory on the wreckage of his flying machine.

Housesitter

Newton Davis (Steve Martin) is a struggling architect.
After building his dream house for himself and his longtime girlfriend Becky (Dana Delany) in his hometown, he is crushed when she refuses to marry him.
He is unable to bring himself to live in the house, and leaves it abandoned and with a debt he cannot afford.
Some time later, Newton meets a waitress named Gwen (Goldie Hawn) at a Hungarian restaurant.
Believing that she cannot speak English, he spills out his sob story about Becky and the abandoned house.
After the restaurant closes for the night, Newton learns she merely pretended to be Hungarian, and can speak English.
He walks her home, which turns out to be a few steps away.
They end up sleeping together.
The next morning, Gwen finds that Newton left in the middle of the night.
However, he unintentionally left behind the drawing of the house he'd built for Becky.
Interest piqued by the drawing, Gwen takes a bus ride out to see the house.
She is charmed by it, and decides to move in.
Gwen goes to the town's general store, where she charges her groceries to the "Newton Davis" account.
When questioned about this, Gwen, who it becomes clear is a natural liar, says that she is Newton's wife.
Gwen meets Becky, and spins a lengthy romantic story about how they fell in love, which surprises and impresses Becky.

Soon after, Newton travels to his hometown and is shocked to see that his house is lived in.
When he finds out what Gwen has done he is initially furious, but he soon sees the potential in her being there.
Gwen starts creating all sorts of opportunities for Newton: mending his relationship with his parents, helping out with his career by befriending Newton's boss and highlighting his long-ignored talent, and making Becky jealous.
Newton and Gwen come to an agreement in which Gwen will help Newton win Becky, and in return she'll get all the furniture in the house.
Through their time together, Newton begins to rely more on Gwen beyond their agreement, and Gwen starts to feel attached to her life with Newton.
It is also revealed that Gwen became a compulsive liar in order to escape from what she feels is her own inadequate background, and that she has "changed" her life numerous times.

Annoyed with Becky for her superior and suspicious attitude, Gwen confronts her in front of everyone, accusing her of trying to win Newton back.
Gwen storms out of the house in tears, and Newton follows her, thinking it is still part of the plan.
Outside alone, Newton praises Gwen for her brilliance, but Gwen replies that she wanted their marriage to work.
Her feelings for him are apparent.
Newton watches, confused, as Gwen leaves.
Becky takes the opportunity to make a move on Newton, and asks whether all of Gwen's elaborate stories were real.
Newton answers that they were all true and chases after Gwen.
Newton stops Gwen as she is about to board a bus to leave town.
Although she resists, Newton follows her example and begins telling an outlandish romantic story of something they "did", which makes Gwen decide to stay.
The film ends on the note of Newton and Gwen being happily married and living together in the house.
As Newton and Gwen go into the house to have sex, the final spoken words are of Newton saying "I love you, Gwen" and Gwen replying, "Actually, it's Jessica".

The First Wives Club

At Middlebury College in 1969, four young friends, Annie MacDuggan, Elise Elliot, Brenda Morelli, and Cynthia Swann, are graduating.
As graduation gifts, valedictorian Cynthia presents the girls with matching Bvlgari pearl necklaces.
As the graduates take a commemorative picture of the four of them (presumably for the last time), Cynthia makes Annie, Brenda and Elise promise that they will always be there for each other throughout the remainder of their lives.
In the present time, the four friends eventually lose touch with one another, as evident when Cynthia (Stockard Channing) is tearfully gazing at the picture of the four of them on that graduation day.
Now wealthy and living in a luxurious penthouse, she gives her maid her own Bulgari pearl necklace (matching the three she gave to her friends on graduation day), and has the maid mail letters to them.
She later walks outside of the balcony of her penthouse in a floor length fur coat, a cigarette and a drink, and then commits suicide by jumping to her death after learning through the tabloids that her ex-husband Gil (whom Cynthia made wealthy through her connections, according to narrator Annie) married his much younger mistress the day before.
Her former friends aren't doing much better: Annie (Diane Keaton), meanwhile, is separated, suffering extreme self-esteem issues, and going through therapy with her husband.
Brenda (Bette Midler) is divorced, left for a younger woman, depressed, and struggling financially.
Elise (Goldie Hawn), whose husband also left her for a younger woman, is now an aging alcoholic movie actress who has become a plastic-surgery addict to keep her career afloat.
Shortly after Cynthia's funeral, at which the three remaining friends are reunited for the first time since college, Annie's husband, Aaron (Stephen Collins), leaves her for her younger therapist (Marcia Gay Harden) and asks her for a divorce after spending a night together (and leading Annie to believe it would reconcile them); Brenda has a rather unpleasant encounter at a clothing store with her ex, Morty (Dan Hedaya) and his younger and rather hateful mistress Shelly (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Elise finds out that her soon-to be ex-husband, Bill (Victor Garber), is requesting alimony and half of their marital assets claiming that Elise owes her fame to him.
Also, during a meeting with a director for a possible leading lady movie role, she discovers that she is only to play the lead female's mother; she later learns the lead female is Bill's current girlfriend.
Shortly thereafter, the three friends receive the letters that Cynthia mailed to them before her suicide.
After each one reads her letter from Cynthia, and feeling that they have been taken for granted by their husbands, the women decide to create the First Wives Club, aiming to get revenge on their exes.
Annie's lesbian daughter Chris (Jennifer Dundas) also gets in on the plan by asking for a job at her father's advertising agency so she can supply her mother with inside information, as payback for Aaron's unfairness toward Annie.
Brenda finds out through her uncle Carmine (Philip Bosco) who has Mafia connections that Morty is guilty of income tax fraud, while Annie makes a plan to revive her advertising career and buy out Aaron's partners.
However, as their plan moves through, things start to fall apart when they find out that Bill has no checkered past and nothing for them to use against him.
Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart.
When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they want to see this to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows.
As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress (Elizabeth Berkley) is actually a minor.
Deciding that revenge would make them no better than their husbands, they instead use these situations to push their men into funding the establishment of a nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding abused women, in memory of their college friend Cynthia.
The film ends with a celebration at the new Cynthia Swann Griffin Crisis Center for Women.
Annie narrates that Elise started a relationship with a cast member in her new, successful play, that Brenda and Morty reconciled their differences and got back together, and that when Aaron tried to get back together with her, Annie told him to "drop dead".
While outside the center Bill meets Shelly and the two start to flirt.
The film concludes with the three women joyfully singing Lesley Gore's hit "You Don't Own Me".
This sequence was choreographed by Patricia Birch and her assistant choreographer was Jonathan Cerullo.

The 40-Year-Old Virgin

Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is a 40-year-old virgin who lives alone, collects action figures, plays video games, and his social life seems to consist of watching Survivor with his elderly neighbors.
He works in the stockroom at SmartTech, an electronics store.
When a friend drops out of a poker game, Andy's co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen), and Jay (Romany Malco) reluctantly invite Andy.
At the game, when conversation turns to past sexual exploits, the group learns that Andy is still a virgin.
The group resolves to help Andy lose his virginity.
Throughout the next several days, the group's efforts prove to be unsuccessful, partly because all three men give Andy different and sometimes contradictory advice.
They take him to have his chest waxed, which he gives up halfway.
Cal advises Andy to simply ask questions when talking to women, which makes Andy seem mysterious.
His advice proves to be the most helpful, when Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a bookstore clerk, takes a liking to Andy.
Andy starts to open up, and begins to form friendships with his co-workers.
After running into his ex-girlfriend Amy in a speed dating event, David, who is still obsessed over her, has an emotional breakdown while making a sale.
Store manager Paula (Jane Lynch) sends him home and promotes Andy to fill in for him.
Jay attempts to quicken the process by hiring Andy a prostitute.
When Andy discovers the hooker is a male transvestite, he confronts his friends and tells them that he will manage a date with a woman on his own.
Andy lands a date with Trish Piedmont (Catherine Keener), a woman he met on the sales floor.
During Andy and Trish's first date, as they are about to have sex, they are interrupted by Trish's teenage daughter Marla (Kat Dennings).
Andy prepares to tell Trish he is a virgin, but Trish suggests that they postpone having sex.
Andy enthusiastically agrees; they decide to postpone it to the 20th date.
At work, Paula is impressed by Andy's salesmanship and promotes him to floor manager.
As Andy's 20th date draws closer, his friends begin to deal with the consequences of their lifestyles.
David, still spiraling in his obsession with Amy, has become disillusioned with sex and has taken a vow of celibacy.
Cal, worried about him, hires Bernadette (Marika Dominczyk), an attractive woman, to fill in for Andy.
Jay gets into an argument with an obnoxious customer (Kevin Hart).
He confides with Andy that his girlfriend Jill learned of his infidelity and broke up with him.
Andy comforts Jay, who says that sex can ruin a relationship.
Jill later decides to take Jay back (she is pregnant, and her misgivings about Jay as a father figure were what had spurred the breakup).
Andy and Trish's relationship grows, and Trish suggests that Andy sell his collectible action figures, which will earn him enough money to open his own store.
Later, Andy takes Marla to a sexual health clinic, where Marla reveals herself to be a virgin.
The counselor (Nancy Carell) remains sympathetic, while the other patients in the clinic laugh at Marla.
Andy admits that he is a virgin as well, but only gains ridicule himself.
On the way back to Trish's house, Marla tells Andy that she has known he is a virgin for a while.
She promises to let Andy tell this to Trish by himself.
On their 20th date, Andy is still reluctant about sex and resists Trish, upsetting her.
An argument ensues, in which Andy accuses Trish of pushing him into changing his life against his will.
He leaves for the nightclub where Jay is celebrating his girlfriend's pregnancy.
David finally relinquishes his celibacy and hooks up with Bernadette.
Andy gets drunk and, after running into Beth, goes to her apartment with her.
Marla convinces Trish to go and make up with Andy.
By this time Andy has sobered up and, after witnessing Beth's methods of foreplay, he starts to have second thoughts.
His friends arrives and encourage Andy to go back to Trish.
They leave together (except for Cal), and Andy returns to his apartment, where he finds Trish waiting for him.
He attempts to apologize, but Trish, having found various suspicious items in his apartment, is now afraid that Andy may be some sort of sexual deviant.
Andy tries to convince her otherwise and declares his love for her, but she leaves in alarm and disgust.
Andy chases after her on his bike, but collides with her car and flies headlong into the side of a truck.
Trish rushes to him in concern, and he finally confesses to her that he is a virgin.
She is surprised to learn that this is the reason behind his strange behavior, as she does not consider it to be important, and they kiss.
Later, Andy and Trish are married in a lavish ceremony with everyone in attendance, with a sidelong mention of Andy's action figures having sold for half a million dollars.
Afterwards, they consummate the marriage over a period of two hours and three minutes, transitioning into a musical scene where the characters sing and dance to "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In".

The infamous vampire Count Dracula is expelled from his castle by the Communist government of Romania, which plans to convert the structure into a training facility for gymnasts (the head trainer declares that it will include Nadia Comăneci).
The world-weary Count travels to New York City with his bug-eating manservant, Renfield, and establishes himself in a hotel, but only after a mix-up at the airport causes his coffin to be accidentally sent to be the centerpiece in a funeral at a black church in Harlem.
While Dracula learns that America contains such wonders as blood banks and discotheques, he also proceeds to suffer the general ego-crushing that comes from life in the Big Apple in the late 1970s as he romantically pursues flaky fashion model Cindy Sondheim, whom he has admired from afar and believes to be the current reincarnation of his true love (an earlier being named Mina Harker).
Dracula is ineptly pursued in turn by Sondheim's psychiatrist and quasi-boyfriend Jeffrey Rosenberg.
Jeffrey is the grandson of Dracula's old nemesis Fritz (sic) van Helsing but changed his name to Rosenberg "for professional reasons".
Rosenberg's numerous methods to combat Dracula - mirrors, garlic, a Star of David (which he uses instead of the cross), and hypnosis - are easily averted by the Count.
Rosenberg also tries burning Dracula's coffin with the vampire still inside, but is arrested by hotel security.
Subsequently he tries to shoot him with three silver bullets, but Dracula remains unscathed, patiently explaining that this works only on werewolves.
Rosenberg's increasingly erratic actions eventually cause him to be locked up as a lunatic, but as mysterious cases of blood-bank robberies and vampiric attacks begin to spread, NYPD Lieutenant Ferguson starts to believe the psychiatrist's claims and gets him released.
In the end, as a major blackout hits the city, Dracula flees via taxi cab back to the airport with Cindy, pursued by Rosenberg and Ferguson.
The coffin is accidentally sent to Jamaica instead of London and the couple miss their plane.
On the runway, Cindy finally agrees to become Dracula's vampire bride.
Rosenberg attempts to stake Dracula, but as he moves in for the kill, the two fly off as bats together.
A check drops down by which Cindy pays off her (enormous) psychiatry bill to Rosenberg, to which he remarks: "She has become a responsible person.
or whatever".
Rosenberg keeps Dracula's cape - the only thing his stake had hit - which Ferguson borrows, hoping (since the cape makes the wearer look stylish) it will help him on his wedding anniversary.
The last scene shows Dracula and Cindy, transformed into bats, on their way to Jamaica.

One day, her editor-in-chief, Rigfort (Garry Marshall) assigns her to report undercover at a high school to help parents become more aware of their children's lives.
Her first day at South Glen South High School is miserable.
Josie reverts to the old geek persona that ruined her first high school career.
She also has an unfortunate run-in with three obnoxious popular girls (Jordan Ladd, Jessica Alba, and Marley Shelton), and Guy Perkins (Jeremy Jordan), the school's most attractive, popular student.
Josie loses hope, but is reassured when a kind-hearted nerd named Aldys (Leelee Sobieski) befriends her.

Josie develops a crush on her English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan), and becomes the top student in his class.
After reciting a romantic excerpt from Shakespeare to Sam, Josie has horrible flashbacks to when she read a romantic poem aloud in class to her high school crush, a popular boy named Billy Prince (Denny Kirkwood), who later asked her to their senior prom, making her dream come true.

The Butcher's Wife

As a clairvoyant, Marina awaits signs from beyond that her true love, whoever he may be, is waiting for her, somewhere.
When New York butcher Leo Lemke shows up on the tiny North Carolina island of Ocracoke, where Marina lives, she is convinced that he is the man predestined to be her husband.
After the wedding, Marina moves into Leo's blue-collar neighborhood, where she successfully commiserates with such eccentrics as withdrawn teenager Eugene, frustrated singer Stella Keefover, unlucky-in-love actress Robyn Graves, over analytical psychiatrist dr Alex Tremor, and closeted lesbian dress shop clerk Grace.
But what Marina fails to grasp about her powers is that she can see the future of strangers far more clearly than her own, and love is unpredictable no matter how many ways you have to look for it.
The film makes use of several phenomena that can be described as occult portents that meeting a love match is imminent or occult tools to help strengthen, seal or bring about love, luck and happiness.
These include the sudden "finding" of a ring that would serve as a wedding band, falling stars with twin tails, zig-zagged rainbows and found objects symbolizing a change in the finder's path that will cause it to cross with their beloved.
It also popularizes, as the character of Alex Tremor calls it, "a corruption" of a section of Plato's Symposium regarding soul mates, referred to in the movie as "split aparts".
In one scene, dr Tremor notes an aspect of Marina's visions, and Marina says: "Women have been burned for less".
This is a reference to the witch persecutions in Europe and America between the 15th and 19th centuries, the most famous of which were the Salem Witch Trials, although no "witches" were burned in the Salem hysteria.
Lastly, it also references common-use bastardizations of voodoo practices, such as "mojo" bags (or gris gris) and the use of chickens or toads.

Herbie Rides Again

Notorious real estate magnate and demolition baron Alonzo Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is ready to build his newest indoor shopping center, the 130-story Hawk Plaza in San Francisco.
His only obstacle is the 1892 firehouse inhabited by "Grandma" Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz; her displaced neighbor, flight attendant Nicole Harris (Stefanie Powers); and their sentient machines: a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle known as Herbie, "the Love Bug;" an early 19th-century orchestrion that plays on its own; and a retired cable car from the defunct Clay Street Line, known as "Old No.
22".
mrs Steinmetz explains that Tennessee has gone to Tibet to visit his ailing philosophy teacher, while Herbie's former owner, Jim Douglas, has gone to Europe.
Hawk has made numerous attempts at evicting mrs Steinmetz, intending to imprison her in a retirement home of his own making; but Hawk's lawyers have been unsuccessful in these attempts, and when his lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) comes to visit him, Hawk sends him to mrs Steinmetz in their stead.
Having met the firehouse's inhabitants, Willoughby becomes disillusioned and decides to return home to Missouri.
Nicole also punches Willoughby in the face upon learning he works for Hawk.
She offers him a ride in Herbie, and Herbie goes berserk after Willboughy insults him twice, eventually taking the two to a car version of a joust tournament, which Herbie wins, earning Willboughy a whooping $300.
The two then go to lunch, but Nicole hits Willboughy with a broiled lobster when he spits out that Hawk is his uncle - after going through an uninterrupted monologue on all the horrible things Hawk has done, including building a parking garage on the very same lot where Joe DiMaggio and his brothers learned to play baseball.
Having lost him, Hawk attempts to capture Herbie; but when Hawk insults him, Herbie causes a series of traffic collisions and discards Hawk at his own office door, where Hawk orders his subordinates to capture Herbie again, followed by a policeman giving Hawk several tickets for traffic offenses.
While Herbie takes mrs Steinmetz to market, they are chased by Hawk's men; whereupon Herbie makes several daring escapes culminating in travel through the 1909 landmark Sheraton Palace Hotel and along a suspension cable on the Golden Gate Bridge, leaving mrs Steinmetz unfazed of his activity throughout.
Willoughby having decided to go home in disguise, he is convinced by Nicole to stay after she hears him criticize his uncle while talking to his mother on the telephone.
On their return to the firehouse, they find that every item of furniture has been removed by Hawk; whereupon mrs Steinmetz, Willoughby, Nicole, and Herbie track the theft to a warehouse.
The four break in and recover Steinmetz's belongings, piling them all into "No.
22" with mrs Steinmetz riding along, while Nicole and Willoughby follow in Herbie.
An inebriated old-timer named Judson (John McIntire) joins Mrs Steinmetz aboard "No.
22," thinking himself on a public cable car.
Hawk pursues; but Herbie distracts him and later rescues mrs Steinmetz and Judson from a potential crash after "No.
22" rolls down a hill.
During this time, mrs Steinmetz becomes enamored with Judson.
Hawk thereafter recruits an independent demolition agent named Loostgarten (Chuck McCann); while Mrs Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself.
Accompanied by Willoughby, she drives Herbie onto the window-cleaning machine of Hawk’s skyscraper to reach his 28th-floor office, where mrs Steinmetz overhears a telephoned conversation with Loostgarten about the deal to demolish the firehouse and activates the window cleaning machine to fill the office with foam and water.
This done, Herbie pursues Hawk around the building's perimeter - even following him outside onto a ledge - until Mrs Steinmetz orders him to desist.
Disguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby directs Loostgarten to demolish Hawk's own house.
Loostgarten then telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from several nightmares showing himself at the mercy of Herbie; whereupon Hawk gives confirmation, but realizes too that he has ordered demolition of his own residence and attacks Loostgarten after a portion of his house is collapsed from a wrecking ball.
In the morning, Hawk calls a truce with mrs Steinmetz, and thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner, while mrs Steinmetz invites Judson to a similar meeting; but Hawk violates the truce by sending earthmovers to crush the firehouse and its inhabitants, prompting Herbie to go in search of Nicole and Willoughby.
In the absence of Herbie, the only means of defense is an antique Fire hose, which Judson uses against the earthmovers.
Having obtained Nicole and Willoughby, Herbie rounds up several other Volkswagen Beetles from various places in the city, and comes after Hawk and his men as an army and ruin his scheme.
Hawk is pursued from the grounds by Herbie, and arrested by the police.
Later, Nicole and Willoughby are married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his new Volkswagen Beetle friends.

I Married a Witch

Two witches in colonial Salem, Jennifer (Veronica Lake) and her father Daniel (Cecil Kellaway), are burned at the stake after being denounced by Puritan Jonathan Wooley (Fredric March) and their ashes buried beneath a tree to imprison their evil spirits.
In revenge, Jennifer curses Wooley and all his male descendants, dooming them always to marry the wrong woman.
Centuries pass.
Generation after generation, Wooley men - all played by March - marry cruel, shrewish women.
Finally, in 1942, lightning splits the tree, freeing the spirits of Jennifer and Daniel.
They discover Wallace Wooley (March again), living nearby and running for governor, on the eve of marrying the ambitious and spoiled Estelle Masterson (Susan Hayward), whose father (Robert Warwick) just happens to be Wooley's chief political backer.
Initially, Jennifer and Daniel manifest themselves as white vertical smoky 'trails', occasionally hiding in empty (or sometimes not-so-empty) bottles of alcohol.
Jennifer persuades her father to create a human body for her so she can torment the latest Wooley.
He needs a fire to perform the spell, so he burns down a building (appropriately enough, the Pilgrim Hotel).
This serves dual purposes, as Jennifer uses it to get the passing Wallace to rescue her from the flames.
Jennifer tries hard to seduce Wallace without magic, but though he is strongly attracted to her, he refuses to put off his marriage.
She concocts a love potion, but her scheme goes awry when a painting falls on her; Wallace revives her by giving her the drink she had intended for him.
Jennifer's father conjures himself a body.
Then he and Jennifer crash the wedding, though they are at cross purposes.
Daniel hates all Wooleys and tries to prevent his daughter from helping one of them.
His attempts at interference land him in jail, too drunk to remember the spell to turn Wallace into a frog.
Meanwhile, Estelle finds the couple embracing and the wedding is called off.
Her outraged father promises to denounce the candidate in all his newspapers.
Wallace finally admits that he loves Jennifer, and they elope.
Jennifer then works overtime with her witchcraft to rescue her new husband's political career.
She conjures up little clouds of brainwashing white smoke that "convince" every voter to support Wallace, and he is elected in a landslide, where even his opponent doesn't vote for himself.
The unanimous vote for him convinces Wallace that she is a witch.
In disgust, Daniel strips his daughter of her magical powers, and vows to return her to the tree that imprisoned them.
In a panic, Jennifer interrupts Wallace's victory speech, imploring him to help her escape.
Unfortunately, the taxi they get into to get away is driven by her father, who takes them in an airborne ride back to the tree.
At the stroke of midnight, Wallace is left with Jennifer's lifeless body, while two plumes of smoke watch.
Before they return to the tree, Jennifer asks to watch Wallace's torment.
While Daniel gloats, Jennifer reclaims her body, explaining to Wallace, "Love is stronger than witchcraft".
She alertly puts the top back on the bottle of liquor her father is hiding in, keeping him drunk and powerless.
The movie concludes years later, after Wallace and Jennifer have children, where the housekeeper enters to complain about their youngest daughter, who enters riding a broom.

Mom and Dad Save the World

Emperor Tod Spengo (Jon Lovitz), with General Afir (Thalmus Rasulala) at his side, takes over a small planet at the edge of the galaxy populated entirely by idiots, and renames it after himself.
He orders that all the resources of the planet should be engaged to create his "Super Death Ray Laser"; the laser's purpose is to destroy Earth, thus making Spengo the greatest planet in the Universe.
When Spengo looks at exactly where his laser would strike, he sees Marge Nelson (Teri Garr) exercising — and falls in love.
Using his Magnobeam (a giant magnet), he kidnaps Marge and her husband, Dick (Jeffrey Jones), as they are on their way to a 20th-anniversary weekend, hoping to make Marge his wife before he blows up the Earth.
Dick and Marge get separated on Spengo: Marge is sent to the lap of luxury, waited on by small people with fish or dog heads, while Dick is thrown into a dungeon.
In the dungeon, however, Dick meets the rightful king of Spengo, Raff (Eric Idle), who has plans hidden in his pants for his son, called the White Bird, out in the desert.
Spengo quickly finds that his advances towards Marge are failing, so he tries to read Dick's mind in order to discover the secret to her heart.
Following Dick's mind-probing, one of the Destroyers, Sibor (Wallace Shawn), has a change of heart when asked to execute the Earthman.
Encouraging Dick to not lose his woman and their love, the diminutive Destroyer frees Dick and helps him break out of the chamber.
Despite the stupidity of his captors, Dick is soon discovered and forced down a garbage chute to the sewers.
While in the dark, inundated tunnel, he is approached by a cute-looking mushroom-like creature, a Lub-Lub.
Dick attempts to pet the creature, but it immediately reveals its true carnivorous nature, forcing him to run for his life.
Dick manages to escape the sewers and steal an escape pod, and winds up crashing miles away in the desert, where he meets the rightful king's son, Sirk (Dwier Brown), and daughter, Semage (Kathy Ireland), as well as their followers.
All of them are dressed as 6-foot-tall birds, although such creatures are not naturally found on Spengo, and the only weapons they have to fight the Emperor and the Destroyers are rocks, their "intelligence" and a number of stolen weapons, including Light Grenades, which completely disintegrate anyone who picks one up.
At first, the rebels don't trust Dick and begin to torture him.
When Dick reveals that he shared a cell with Raff and that he is on their side, their attitude quickly changes, and Dick rises to the rank of war leader.
Using what little resources he can scrounge up, he devises a plan to sneak back into Spengo's palace and save Marge.
He even inspires Raff's followers with a rousing speech, during which he says, "Just because you're stupid that doesn't mean you can't rule a planet.
Hey.
Come to Earth sometime".
In the meantime, General Afir, who appears to be the only intelligent person among Spengo's forces, believes that Dick and Marge are the key to ending Spengo's rule, so he hatches a plan to stop the megalomaniac.
He switches the love serum meant for Marge with water and informs her of his intentions to search for Dick, but Spengo overhears Afir's plan and has him placed in the barrel of the laser, to die when Earth is destroyed.
During the wedding ceremony, a detachment of Spengo's soldiers go into the desert to finish the rebels, but find their camp deserted, and one by one they fall victim to one of the Light Grenades which has been left on Dick's pallet.
In the meantime, Dick approaches Spengo's fortress with a large wooden bust of Spengo, reading "In Tod We Trust".
At first Spengo says it is an obvious trick, but in the end he tells the guards to bring it in.
In the midst of the wedding ceremony, Dick and the others emerge from the Trojan bust and the final battle begins.
As fighting rages in the castle, Tod retreats to his lab with Marge and prepares to fire the laser at Earth.
Dick and Tod clash with swords, but neither gains the upper hand, as both are clumsy fighters.
Marge manages to use Dick's sword to cut her bonds and helps Dick defeat Tod and knock him into the garbage chute.
As the two of them kiss and exchange "I love you"'s, the bound and gagged Afir gives them a muffled reminder about the Death Ray, and they manage to shut it off as the countdown makes it half-way to zero.
Meanwhile, Tod crash lands in the sewers where he is eaten alive (offscreen) by the Lub-Lubs.
With Tod deceased, the rightful king is reinstated and he reverses the polarity on the Magnobeam to send Dick and Marge back home to Southern California.
They arrive home with some slight damage to the station wagon (which stuns their kids), and then proceed to show their son, daughter, and her boyfriend slides (including an image of Dick in front of Saturn) from what they claim is "Santa Barbara".
Their daughter, Stephanie (Suzanne Ventulett) and her boyfriend, Carl (Michael Stoyanov), find the images weird, but their son, Alan (Danny Cooksey) enjoys it.
To end their anniversary, Dick and Marge share drinks on the roof, watching the stars.

Solid Serenade

Near a house is a doghouse labeled "Killer" with a dog (Spike) in it.
Tom pokes his head over the wall and spots a female cat (Toodles Galore) in the window.
Tom brings along his string instrument (possibly a double bass or cello), then wakes up Spike and neutralizes him by whacking him in the head with a mallet and tying him up.
Tom uses his instrument as a pogo stick to hop over to the window, stopping halfway to taunt Spike along the way.
Tom plays "Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby"; the sound waves from the instrument shake Jerry's mousehole, bouncing Jerry off the bed, then under the table, and Jerry's head is hit by a vase that falls off the table when the mouse comes out the other side.
Having had enough, the mouse gets his revenge by going into the kitchen and hurling a pie with an iron stuffed inside; the cat is angered, but continues with a few more bars.
Seconds later, he is hit in the face again – this time with a pie covered in whipped cream.
Spotting Jerry, Tom chases him through the house.
Both animals dive off an ironing board; with Jerry ahead of Tom, Jerry drains the kitchen sink he landed in, leaving Tom to crash into the crockery.
Tom follows Jerry through the open window, but Jerry pulls the window stop out of the window.
The window falls on Tom's neck, and Tom shrieks in pain.
Jerry then runs out and unties Spike, and the dog lets out a loud bull roar, which starts a new chase.
Spike swaps his small teeth for "heavy-duty" ones, blows off some pent-up steam, and goes after Tom.
Tom ducks as Spike's teeth come at him, which instead get lodged in a tree trunk.
Tom then barely avoids getting his tail bitten and hides behind a wall, holding a brick up ready to attack.
Spike sees the brick and investigates, but gets knocked on the head with it.
With his ally eliminated, Jerry revives Spike by hitting him with a wooden plank.
After slamming Spike, Spike leaps high in the air screaming in pain just as Jerry hands off the board to Tom, framing the cat.
Knowing he is in trouble, Tom tricks Spike into believing the board is a bone by playing "fetch".
Spike obliges and fetches but realises he's been tricked.
Tom and Spike then begin a back and forth chase with Toodles Galore watching on.
Tom stops periodically to kiss the cat.
Catching on to this habit, Spike substitutes himself on the third pass, and gets wooed in a Charles Boyer voice (his lines recycled from The Zoot Cat).
Tom stops his speech abruptly when he sees the female cat and, realizing his mistake, drops Spike onto the floor.
Tom hides from Spike's rampage until Jerry walks around the corner; he chases Jerry to Spike's house, which Jerry immediately hides in.
Tom then sneaks into the doghouse with a murderous Dracula laugh while closing the door, indicating that something most foul is going to occur.
A second later, the door opens and Spike pokes his head out, helps Jerry out of his house and laughs even more evilly as he withdraws inside to.
The entire dog house thrashes about as Spike beats up Tom, who at one point quickly writes his will before being wrenched back in and beaten to within an inch of his life.
At the end, Toodles Galore watches Spike strum Tom, who had replaced the strings on his instrument, while Jerry plays a quick riff on Tom's whiskers.

The Lemon Drop Kid

The Lemon Drop Kid (Bob Hope), a New York City swindler, is illegally touting horses at a Florida racetrack.
The Kid touts across a beautiful woman intending to bet $2,000 on a horse named Iron Bar.
Rigging a con, the Kid convinces her to switch her bet, but learns that she was betting for boyfriend and notorious gangster Moose Moran (Fred Clark).
When the horse finishes dead last, a furious Moran demands the Kid pay him $10,000 (the amount he would have won) by Christmas Eve, or the Kid "won't make it to New Year's".
The Kid decides to return to New York to try to come up with the money.
He first tries his on-again, off-again girlfriend Brainey Baxter (Marilyn Maxwell).
However, when talk of long-term commitment arises, the Kid quickly makes an escape.
He next visits local crime boss Oxford Charlie (Lloyd Nolan), with whom he has had past dealings.
However, Charlie is in serious tax trouble and does not particularly care for the Kid anyway.
As he leaves Charlie's establishment, the Kid notices a street corner Santa Claus and his kettle.
Thinking quickly, the Kid fashions himself a Santa suit and begins collecting donations.
He is recognized by a passing policeman, and the Kid is convicted of panhandling and sentenced to ten days in jail when he cannot pay the fine.
The Kid learns where his scheme went wrong.
After Brainey bails him out, he sets about making his scam legitimate by finding a charity to represent and a city license.
The Kid remembers that Nellie Thursday (Jane Darwell), a kindly neighborhood resident, has been denied entry to a retirement home because of her jailed husband's criminal past.
Organizing other small-time New York swindlers and Brainey, who is both surprised and charmed at the Kid's apparent goodwill, the Kid converts an abandoned casino (ironically belonging to Moose Moran) into the "Nellie Thursday Home For Old Dolls".
A small group of elderly women and makeshift amenities complete the project.
The Kid receives the all-important city license.
Now free to collect, the Kid and his compatriots dress up as Santa Claus and position themselves throughout Manhattan.
The others are unaware that the Kid plans to keep the money for himself to pay off Moran.
The scheme is a huge success, netting $2,000 in only a few days.
An overjoyed Brainey decides to leave her job as a dancer and look after the "home" full-time until after Christmas.
She informs her employer, Oxford Charlie.
Seeing a potential gold mine, Charlie decides to muscle in on the operation.
Reasoning that the Nellie Thursday home is "wherever Nellie Thursday is", Oxford Charlie and his crew kidnap the home's inhabitants (including Nellie and Brainey) and move them to Charlie's mansion in Nyack.
The Kid returns to the home to find it deserted and the money he had hidden in a hollowed-out statue gone.
Clued in by oversized Oxford footprints in the snow, the Kid and his friends pay Charlie a visit.
When Charlie reveals the Kid's scheme through a phone conversation with Moose Moran, the Kid's accomplices become angry, but he manages to slip away.
However, Brainey tracks him down and voices her disgust.
After a few days of stewing in self-pity (and realizing it is Christmas Eve), the Kid is surprised to meet Nellie, who has escaped.
He decides to recover the money, sneaking into Charlie's home in the guise of an elderly woman.
He finds that Charlie and his crew are moving the women to a more secure location.
The Kid confronts Charlie in his office.
After a brief struggle, the Kid overpowers Charlie and makes off with the money, narrowly avoiding the thugs Charlie has sent after him.
The ensuing chaos allows Brainey and the others to escape.
Later that night, the Kid returns to the original Nellie Thursday home to meet with Moose Moran.
The deal appears to be in jeopardy as Moran arrives with Charlie.
Charlie demands that the Kid reimburse him, which would leave too little for Moran.
However, the Kid hits a switch, revealing hidden casino tables.
All are occupied, mainly by the escaped women.
The Kid and his still-loyal friends hold off the gangsters as the police initiate a raid.
Moran and Oxford Charlie are arrested.
The Kid assures the judge who sentenced him earlier that he will focus his attention on the home, which he will make a reality.
Nellie's husband Henry, free on parole, is joyously reunited with his wife.

Me and You and Everyone We Know

The structure of the film consists of several subplots which all revolve around an intertwined cast of characters.
The film begins by introducing Richard (John Hawkes), a shoe salesman and recently separated father of two.
After being thrown out by his wife Pam (JoNell Kennedy), he gets an apartment of his own to share with his children, Peter (Miles Thompson) and Robby (Brandon Ratcliff).
He meets Christine (Miranda July), a senior-cab driver and amateur video artist, while she takes her client to shop for shoes, and the two develop a fledgling romantic relationship.
Robby, six years old, and his 14-year-old brother, Peter, have a joint online chat which he later depicts in another chat session as "))<>((", an emoticon that means "pooping back and forth, forever".
This piques the interest of the woman at the other end and she suggests a real life meeting.
When Robby and the woman meet at a park, she realizes he's a child and kisses him and walks away.
Two of Richard's teenaged neighbors, Heather (Natasha Slayton) and Rebecca (Najarra Townsend), develop a playful relationship with a much older neighbor Andrew (Brad William Henke) who works in the shoe store with Richard.
He does not say much, but he keeps leaving signs on his window about what he would do to each of them.
As a result of this relationship, Heather and Rebecca ask Peter if they can practice oral sex on him, so that he can tell them which of the two does it better; so they do.
He says both were exactly the same.
The daughter of a neighbor peeks in the window, sees what is happening, and quickly leaves.
Heather and Rebecca later come to the neighbor's house intending to have sex with him as practice, but he appears afraid when he sees them through his window and he pretends not to be home.
Meanwhile, Christine's work is rejected by a contemporary art museum, but then later accepted by the curator, who turns out to be the woman who was instant messaging with the brothers.
The plots come together in the end, with Peter developing a friendship with the daughter of a neighbor, having been introduced to the hope chest that she has, Christine and Richard displaying a show of mutual acceptance of their attraction to each other, and, as a final plot device, Robby finding that the noise he had awoken to early every morning was that of an early-rising businessman tapping a quarter on a street sign pole.
When asked why he is doing it, he stops and turns around, saying "just passing the time", and gives Robby the quarter.
When his bus drives away and Robby tries it out himself, the sun heightens with each tap, time literally passing as he does it.

The Palm Beach Story

Tom and Gerry Jeffers (Joel McCrea and Claudette Colbert) are a married couple in New York City who are down on their luck financially, which is pushing the marriage to an end.
But there is a deeper problem with their relationship, just hinted at under the opening credits in the prologue, and only disclosed at the end.
In the prologue Claudette Colbert is bound and gagged in a closet, but a second later appears in a wedding dress.
This scene is cross-cut with groom Joel McCrea hurriedly changing from one formal suit to another while rushing to church for the wedding.
The last scenes finally reveal that both of the original fiancés have identical twins.
Both twins, trying to steal their sibling's intended, inadvertently married each other instead.
The couple remain married from 1937 until 1942, when this story begins.
Gerry decides that Tom would be better off if they split up.

There she plans to get a divorce and meet a wealthy second husband who can help Tom.
On the train, she meets the eccentric John Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallée), one of the richest men in the world.
Because of an encounter with the wild and drunken millionaire members of the Ale and Quail hunting club, Gerry loses all her luggage; after making do with clothing scrounged from other passengers, she is forced to accept Hackensacker's extravagant charity.
They leave the train and go on a shopping spree for everything from lingerie to jewelry – Hackensacker minutely noting the cost of everything in a little notebook, which he never bothers to add up – and make the remainder of the trip to Palm Beach on Hackensacker's yacht named The Erl King (a Sturges joke on the Hackensacker family business, oil).

Tom finally persuades Gerry to give their marriage another chance, and they confess their masquerade to their disappointed suitors.
Even though he is disappointed, Hackensacker intends to go through with his investment in the suspended airport, since he thinks it is a good business deal and he never lets anything get in the way of business.
Then, when Tom and Gerry reveal that they met because they are both identical twins – a fact which explains the opening sequence of the film – Hackensacker and his sister are elated.
The final scene shows Hackensacker and Gerry's sister, and the Princess and Tom's brother, getting married.
The film ends where it began after the prologue, with the words "And they lived happily ever after.

It Should Happen to You

The script, by Garson Kanin, is about a naive young woman named Gladys Glover who yearns for fame.
Strolling through Central Park, she meets a young handsome man named Pete Sheppard (Jack Lemmon).
He is a maker of documentaries (apparently equipped only with a handheld 16mm camera).
He is taking brief shots of people in the park.
He films Gladys feeding pigeons and introduces himself.
In a rapid piece of exposition, we learn Gladys has been in New York City for two years, coming from a job at a shoe factory in Binghamton, New York.
She has just lost her job as a model of girdles, because her hip size is 3/4" larger than it should be, and still has the $1000, which she "saved up".
Gladys is discouraged at having gotten nowhere in two years and she wants to make a name for herself.
It is clear Pete is taken by Gladys.
He gets her address by offering to drop her a postcard when the documentary is finished so she can see herself in it.
"Really.
" she says, "I'd give my right arm to see myself in the movies".
"You don't need to give me your right arm," says Pete, "just give me your right address".
Pete encourages Gladys to follow her dreams: "Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a way there is a will".
The two then part ways.
Wandering despondently, Gladys' attention is caught by a large billboard overlooking Columbus Circle with the notice, "This space for rent.
Choice location.
Inquire Horace Pfeiffer Co, 383 Madison Avenue".
She fantasizes about her name being on the billboard and gathering up the nerve she goes to 383 Madison Avenue to inquire about the billboard.
Gladys asks for "Mr.
Horace Puh-feiffer," pronouncing the letter P, and is corrected by the receptionist who tells her there is no mr Pfeiffer.
Determined, Gladys obtains an interview with a busy man conducting a telephone conversation, who brusquely tells her the sign is available, demands to know "whom she represents," and says "I'm really too busy for this sort of thing".
The spunky Gladys pulls $1000 in cash from her purse, complains that the man is too "stuck up" to listen to her, asks "What sort of place treats people that way" and starts to leave.
The representative relents and tells her the sign is $210 per month, three months minimum.
Gladys pays $630 in cash and arranges to have her name put on the billboard.
Within a few days the sign is up and she is thrilled.
However, it turns out the Adams Soap company has traditionally booked the sign and is upset to learn that another client has obtained it.
The Pfeiffer company calls Gladys to a meeting where Evan Adams III (Lawford) attempts to induce her to give up the sign by offering her more money.
Gladys is not interested.
She is called to another meeting and is offered six signs in exchange for the one.
This time, she accepts.
Now, there are six huge signs in New York, one in lights, each saying simply "Gladys Glover".
Meanwhile, Pete Sheppard has taken an apartment adjacent to Gladys, a move which does not seem to rouse her curiosity, and the two become platonic friends.
Sheppard is, however, exasperated by Gladys' fascination with her signs and her requests he tour the city with her to see them.
Citygoers are intrigued by the mysterious signs.
Gladys shops in a department store (Macy's), and when she gives her name, the word spreads quickly and dozens of people flock around to get the autograph of the famous Gladys Glover.
Soon, she is being asked to appear on television shows.
However, the round of publicity begns to take an unpleasant turn.
Gladys explains she obtained the signs simply in order to, "Make a name for herself," but does not seem to be aware she is being treated as a figure of fun.
Evan Adams III, however, decides she is ripe for exploitation as, "The average American girl," and hires her to do a series of advertisements for Adams Soap.
As Gladys pursues what is becoming a lucrative career, relations between her and Pete become strained.
At the same time, Adams is showing an increasing interest in her.
The situation reaches a crisis when Gladys breaks a date with Pete in order to attend what Adams says is a business conference to discuss a cross-country publicity tour.
The conference turns out to be an attempted seduction.
As Adams reaches to embrace Gladys, she accidentally or intentionally spills a full glass of champagne down the back his neck, breaking the spell.
Gladys says, "I don't mind the way you're acting, exactly.
What I mind is the way you give the idea you're sort of entitled".
Adam then says, "Maybe I am.
Oh, sure, if you want to make it into a sort of business proposition.
That's what you're doing, isn't it.
" Gladys says, "The way it looks to me, mr Adams, is that there are two sorts of people.
The people who will do anything to make a name for themselves, and the people who will do almost anything.
Soon there will be signs all over saying I'm the average American girl.
That was your idea wasn't it.
Well, I don't think the average American girl should do.
this" then Gladys walks out.
When she arrives home she finds a 16&nbsp;mm movie projector in her room with a note from Pete telling her to run it.
A film plays complete with titles and synchronized sound, entitled "Goodby, [sic] Gladys".
The charmingly self-deprecating Pete confesses he loves Gladys, acknowledges that his profile is not as good looking as Adams', and says goodbye.
Gladys' advertising career continues, but she finds its emptiness more and more frustrating.
She recalls Pete's frequent questions as to why she wants to be above the crowd instead of being happy being part of the crowd.
In the meantime, Pete continues to make a go of his documentary film career.
In a cage at a zoo, he makes a documentary showing how the visitors appear to the animals.
He coaches the crowd to react to him as if he was a chimpanzee and he jumps around in the cage, filming the crowd, as they throw him peanuts.
Suddenly, the crowd's attention is distracted by the sound of an airplane.
Puzzled, Pete looks up and sees the plane has skywritten the message, "PETE CALL GLADYS PLEASE".
He grins, the film cuts to Gladys and Pete driving in a car and discussing plans for the future.
Gladys spots an empty billboard with a message, "THIS SPACE FOR RENT.
Apply Acme Realty Co".
Gladys looks to be pondering the possibilities; seeing this a concerned Pete says "What are you looking at.
" Gladys quickly reflects all her troubles that started with her name placed on signs and as she lovingly embraces Pete responds, "Nothing, absolutely nothing.

Out to Sea

Compulsive gambler Charlie Gordon, cons his close friend and brother-in-law, widower Herb Sullivan, whose recently deceased wife, Susie Gordon-Sullivan, was Charlie's sister, into an all expenses-paid luxury Holland America Mexican cruise.
The catch, which Charlie does not reveal to Herb until the ship has left port, is that they are required to work as dance hosts and must sleep in a cramped cabin in the bowels of the ship.
If they don't not dance, they will get fired and have to pay nearly up 3,000 dollars for the cruise, or get thrown off the ship.
Ruled over by tyrannical, control-freak cruise director Gil Godwyn ("a song and dance man raised on a military base"), they do their best, despite Charlie's not actually being able to dance.
Each meets a lady of interest.
One is the luscious heiress Liz LaBreche, whose wealth attracts Charlie every bit as much as the rest of her does.

Liz came on board on the ship with his daughter and her newlywed husband to help her start dating again.
After finally telling her the truth, Herb soon finds himself quite attracted to Vivian, and eventually the feeling becomes mutual.

Champagne for Caesar

Beauregard Bottomley (Ronald Colman) is an unemployed PhD physicist who lives in Los Angeles with his piano-instructor sister Gwenn (Barbara Britton) and the alcohol-guzzling parrot of the film's title, Caesar (Mel Blanc, voice).
Beauregard and Gwenn live in a bungalow court, surrounded by books.
Beauregard is an omnivorous reader, and is highly knowledgeable on virtually any subject - except, as he admits, how to hold a job.
Beauregard obtains word of a mysterious job opportunity at the Milady Soap Company.
He meets the eccentric company owner, Burnbridge Waters (Vincent Price), for the job interview.
Waters disapproves of Beauregard's humour and turns him down for the job, humiliating him in the process.
Later, in front of an appliance store window, Beauregard, Gwenn and a small crowd, none of whom have TV sets yet, watch the radio quiz show - just transferred to the new medium of television - Masquerade for Money, whose sponsor is Milady Soap.
The show's format features contestants costumed as historical characters or items, who are asked questions about who or what their attire represents.
The prize doubles with each successive question, in the style of the 1940s radio show The $64 Question.
If anyone misses just one question, the contestant loses all that was won to that point.
Beauregard is contemptuous of television and what he deems as its anti-intellectual nature, after seeing Masquarade for Money.
However, after seeing the contestants struggle to answer relatively easy questions, Beauregard plots revenge on Burnbridge Waters.
He goes on the program dressed as an encyclopedia to let the host know he will answer any question given to him by the show's host, Happy Hogan (Art Linkletter).
Starting from an initial $5 prize, Beauregard easily answers the maximum five questions, then asks for a sixth question.
The show runs out of time, but Beauregard promises to come back the next week if people will write in to Milady Soap demanding he be allowed to return.
An avalanche of mail inspires Burnbridge Waters.
He decides to call Bottomley back for one question per show - and when they've reached a new high in soap sales, the show will drop him.
Masquerade for Money becomes a ratings triumph.
The country tunes in each week to watch Beauregard, who appears with Caesar on the covers of Look and Life Magazines.
The questions become more erudite and challenging, but Bottomley keeps answering them with ease.
With Beauregard's continuing success and increasing prize amount, Waters becomes uneasy, as the winnings will potentially erode Milady's profits.
Visiting the soap factory one day, Beauregard finally explains to Waters that his ultimate goal is, first, to break Waters by winning $40 million - the entire worth of Milady Soap - and thus drive Waters into bankruptcy.
As Beauregard continues to answer the questions, Waters calls in "Flame" O'Neill (Celeste Holm) to try to weaken Waters via seduction, to find a subject where his knowledge is lacking.
In parallel, Happy Hogan tries to work his charms on Gwenn to see if he also can persuade her to have Beauregard simply pocket his winnings to date, by taking piano lessons with her and asking her out.
Beauregard has become ill with a cold, and Flame insinuates herself into the Bottomley household as Beauregard's nurse, pretending to be a member of his fan club.
With little past experience with women, Beauregard initially succumbs to Flame's charms, and loses his general sang-froid in her presence.
Gwenn is suspicious of Flame's motives, as Beauregard is suspicious of Hogan's motives in suddenly taking piano lessons with her.
Neither sibling is to be deterred by the other from their respective romantic attachments.
Flame, a la Delilah, intends to seduce Bottomley to find out his Achilles' heel, a subject that will stump him.
Slowly, Beauregard becomes suspicious of Flame, after his recovery.
He reveals to her on one date that he (supposedly) never quite mastered Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
With that knowledge, the next question on Masquerade for Money is for Beauregard to explain Einstein's theory.
Now realizing Flame's role in the situation, Beauregard does struggle for an answer, which he provides.
However, Happy Hogan indicates that, by his answer card, the response is wrong.
Waters rejoices as the studio audience groans, and Beauregard wanders into the wings, apparently defeated.
However, a phone call arrives a moment later, from Einstein himself, who has been watching the show.
Einstein explains that in fact, Bottomley gave the correct answer.
Hogan announces the news to a now jubilant audience.
Waters faints, and Bottomley is to return next week.
In the meantime, Happy appears to have genuinely fallen in love with Gwenn.
Flame also has apparently developed some remorse at her part in the plot against Beauregard, and also affection for him.
Waters decides to rent the Hollywood Bowl for the final question of the final show.
Before the last show, with the prize stakes at $20 million, Beauregard and Gwenn decide to test each other's romantic partners and respective engagements.
Each sibling telephones the respective partner to see if they would be willing to be married before the big prize day.
Happy and Flame each come up with excuses for not marrying Gwenn and Beauregard before the last prize show, which deflates both siblings.
At the Hollywood Bowl, after a sardonic introduction from Waters, Beauregard comes onstage, where Happy asks for his wallet.
Happy then asks a very simple question about Beauregard himself, and not about any subject in a book, namely, what is Beauregard's Social Security number.
Beauregard answers incorrectly, to the tremendous relief of Waters and the disappointment of the crowd.
Back home, Beauregard and Gwenn appear disappointed.
However, later that evening, Happy and Flame appear, willing to marry Gwenn and Beauregard respectively after all.
Waters also appears, with gifts for Beauregard.
It turns out that Caesar used to be Waters' pet parrot.
As Beauregard and Flame drive off to be married, Beauregard reveals that he and Waters agreed to a backroom deal where he would lose, but receive his own radio show, as well as Milady Soap stock.
However, Beauregard then admits that he genuinely didn't know the answer to the simple question posed to him at the Hollywood Bowl.
Even so, most anyone watching the movie might well think Beauregard must have known the answer, or else he could not have completed any job applications requiring that information.

Defending Your Life

Daniel Miller (Albert Brooks), a Los Angeles advertising executive, dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to the afterlife.
He arrives in Judgment City, a Purgatory-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased of the western half of the United States, where he is to undergo the process of having his life on Earth judged.
Daniel and the rest of the recently deceased are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities in the city while they undergo their judgment processes—from all-you-can-eat restaurants (which cause no weight gain and serve the best food), to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.
His defense attorney, Bob Diamond (Rip Torn), explains to Daniel that people from Earth use so little of their brains (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their fears.
"When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me," says Diamond.
If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer.
Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.
Daniel's judgment process is presided over by two judges (played by Lillian Lehman and George Wallace).
Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase.
His formidable opponent is Lena Foster (Lee Grant).
Diamond informs Daniel that she is known as "the Dragon Lady".
Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in the defendants' lives, shown to the judges to illustrate their case.
During the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia (Meryl Streep), a woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his.
(She died after slipping on the ground and falling into her pool and drowning) The proceedings do not go well for Daniel.
Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps.
The final nail in his coffin, it seems, is when Foster, on the last day of arguments, plays footage of his previous night with Julia, in which he declines to sleep with her, for what Foster believes is his same fear and lack of courage.
It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth.
Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on.
Before saying goodbye Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right.
Daniel remains disappointed.
Daniel finds himself strapped to a seat on a tram poised to return to Earth, when he spots Julia on a different tram.
On impulse, he unstraps himself, escapes from the moving tram, and risks electrocution and injury to get to Julia.
Although he cannot enter her tram at first, the entire event is being monitored by Foster and Diamond, who convinces the judges that this last-minute display of courage has earned Daniel the right to move on.
The judges agree and open the doors on Julia’s tram, allowing Daniel in, reuniting him with Julia, and allowing them to move on to the next phase of existence together.

That Touch of Mink

Cathy Timberlake, a New York City career woman, meets Philip Shayne after his Rolls Royce splashes her dress with mud while she is on her way to a job interview.
Philip proposes a romantic affair, while Cathy is holding out for marriage.
Watching from the sidelines are Philip's financial manager, Roger, who sees a therapist because he feels guilty about helping his boss with his numerous conquests, and Cathy's roommate, Connie Emerson, who knows what Philip is after.
Philip wines and dines Cathy.
He takes her to see the New York Yankees play baseball.
They watch from the Yankees dugout (he owns part of the team).
Cathy's complaints about the umpire while seated alongside Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Yogi Berra (playing themselves) cause umpire Art Passarella to throw all of them out of the game.
Philip's conscience weighs on him, so he withdraws an invitation to Bermuda, which only serves to make Cathy agree to go.
