    "# A few simple corpus-driven approaches to narrative analysis and generation\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a fast introduction to a few techniques for working with narrative corpora. By \"narrative corpora,\" I mean pre-existing bodies of text that mostly contain the texts of narratives. In particular, we're going to use Mark Riedl's [WikiPlots corpus](https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots), which has the titles and plot summaries of more than one hundred thousand movies, books, television shows and other media from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook takes you through using [spaCy](http://spacy.io) to extract words, noun chunks, parts of speech and entities from the text and then sew them back together with [Tracery](http://tracery.io). It then shows how to use [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) to create new narratives from existing narrative text, and how to prepare the narratives for use as a training corpus for a large pre-trained language model like GPT-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is written in Python, but you don't really need to know Python in order to use the notebook. Everything's pre-written for you, so you can just execute the cells, making small changes to the code as needed. Even if the notebook itself doesn't end up being useful to you, hopefully it spurs a few ideas that you can take with you into your practice as a storyteller and/or programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this code on Binder, you should be good to go. Just keep on executing the cells below. If you're running this notebook on Google Colab, you'll need to run the following cells to install the necessary libraries and download the data:"

    "Another way to produce new narratives from existing narrative text is to find statistical patterns in the text itself and then make the computer create new text that follows those statistical patterns. Markov chain text generation has been a pastime of poets and programmers going back [all the way to 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24969024), so it should be no surprise that there are many implementations of the idea in Python that you can download and install. The one we're going to use is [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), a Markov chain text generation library originally developed for BuzzFeed, apparently. Writing [code to implement a Markov chain generator](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet/blob/master/ngrams-and-markov-chains.ipynb) on your own is certainly possible, but Markovify comes with a lot of extra niceties that will make our lives easier."

    "### Thinking about structure\n",
    "\n",
    "It's one thing to be able to produce one plausible sentence of a plot summary using Markov chains, but another to create a sense of overall structure between sentences, and generating narratives with these kinds of long-term dependencies is still an open problem in computational creativity. The approach I'm going to suggest below relies on the intuition that sentences in a plot summary share characteristics based on their position in the summary. First sentences will generally introduce characters and present an initial situation; last sentences will generally describe how the situation was resolved; and sentences in between will describe developing action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this intuition, let's create *three different Markov chains*: one for beginning sentences, one for middle sentences, and one for final sentences. We can use the `index` of each sentence in our corpus to give us this information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Markov chains are cheap and fun, but they don't do a great job of the one thing we expect from stories: maintaining coherence over a long stretch of text. Accomplishing this is a more difficult task, and requires making use of more sophisticated machine learning models, belonging to the category of large pre-trained neural networks. These models are fundamentally similar to Markov chains, in that they make a prediction about what will come next in a text, given some stretch of context. Unlike a Markov chain, a large pre-trained neural network can predict what will come next in a text, even if the context you give it has never been seen in the training text. It can also work on contexts of arbitrary and variable length. Handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "These language models are already trained on a large amount of text. Generally, you don't train them from scratch on your own, but instead \"fine-tune\" them to bring their probabilities more in line with a particular source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such model, [OpenAI's GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) does a pretty good job of maintaining long-distance coherence, and it's easy to fine-tune the model with Max Woolf's [aitextgen](https://github.com/minimaxir/aitextgen/).  We'll use the [example Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15qBZx5y9rdaQSyWpsreMDnTiZ5IlN0zD?usp=sharing) from the aitextgen repository. This notebook works best when it's fine-tuned on text in a prose format. The model can also learn ad-hoc markup elements that you add to the text. We'll use this feature of the model to make it possible to generate stories from beginning to end, by adding a `[BEGIN STORY]` marker before each story in the source text, followed by the title of the story."
